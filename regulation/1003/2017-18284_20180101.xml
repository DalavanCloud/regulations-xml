In this example, you must report White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and in addition you must report (at your option) either Korean and Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan, or Vietnamese and Samoan.

Thus, using the same facts in the example offered in paragraph 9.iii above, if the applicant also selects Other Asian and enters “Thai” in the space provided, Other Asian and Thai are considered one selection. Similarly, if the applicant enters only “Thai” in the space provided and you report both “Thai” and Other Asian as permitted by this paragraph 9.iv, the reported items together are considered one selection. In the same example, you must report any two (at your option) of the four race subcategories selected by the applicant, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian-Thai, and Samoan, in addition to the three aggregate race categories selected by the applicant.</content>

              <content>An applicant may select the American Indian or Alaska Native race category, an applicant may provide a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe, or an applicant may do both. If the applicant provides only a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe in the space provided, you are permitted, but are not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native in addition to reporting the particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant provides only “Navajo,” you should report “Navajo.” You are permitted, but not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native as well. If an applicant selects the American Indian or Alaska Native race category and also provides a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe, you must report both the selection of American Indian or Alaska Native and the additional information provided by the applicant. For purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined, as set forth in paragraph 9.iii, the American Indian or Alaska Native category and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection.</content>

              <content> Bureau interpretations that appear in the official commentary to Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act, <ref target="CFR:12-1002" reftype="external">12 CFR part 1002</ref>, Supplement I) are generally applicable to the definition of <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> under Regulation C.

            <interpParagraph label="1003-2-b-Interp-2" marker="2.">
              <title>Prequalification.</title>
              <content>A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="term">request for preapproval</ref>) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective loan applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> process; others use the same process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to report prequalification requests on the <ref target="1003-2-k" reftype="term">loan/application register</ref>, even though these requests may constitute <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">applications</ref> under Regulation B for purposes of adverse action notices.</content>

              <title>Requests for preapproval.</title>
              <content>To be a preapproval program as defined in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref>, the written commitment issued under the program must result from a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the applicant, including such verification of income, resources, and other matters as is typically done by the institution as part of its normal credit evaluation program. In addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable property and verification that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home. Regardless of its name, a program that satisfies the definition of a preapproval program in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. Conversely, a program that a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> describes as a “preapproval program” that does not satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is not a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. If a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> does not regularly use the procedures specified in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref>, but instead considers requests for preapprovals on an ad hoc basis, the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> need not treat ad hoc requests as part of a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. A <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should, however, be generally consistent in following uniform procedures for considering such ad hoc requests.</content>

              <content>Under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref>, a dwelling-secured loan is not a closed-end mortgage loan unless it involves an extension of credit. For example, some transactions completed pursuant to installment sales contracts, such as some land contracts, depending on the facts and circumstances, may or may not involve extensions of credit rendering the transactions closed-end mortgage loans. In general, extension of credit under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> refers to the granting of credit only pursuant to a new debt obligation. Thus, except as described in comments 2(d)-2.i and .ii, if a transaction modifies, renews, extends, or amends the terms of an existing debt obligation, but the existing debt obligation is not satisfied and replaced, the transaction is not a closed-end mortgage loan under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> because there has been no new extension of credit. The phrase extension of credit thus is defined differently under Regulation C than under Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002.</content>

                <content>For purposes of Regulation C, an assumption is a transaction in which an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower in place of an existing borrower as the obligor on an existing debt obligation. For purposes of Regulation C, assumptions include successor-in-interest transactions, in which an individual succeeds the prior owner as the property owner and then assumes the existing debt secured by the property. Under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref>, assumptions are extensions of credit even if the new borrower merely assumes the existing debt obligation and no new debt obligation is created.

              <content>A covered loan secured by five or more separate dwellings, which are not multifamily dwellings, in more than one location is not a loan secured by a multifamily dwelling. For example, assume a landlord uses a covered loan to improve five or more dwellings, each with one individual dwelling unit, located in different parts of a town, and the loan is secured by those properties. The covered loan is not secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § <ref target="1003-2-n" reftype="internal">1003.2(n)</ref>. Likewise, a covered loan secured by five or more separate dwellings that are located within a multifamily dwelling, but which is not secured by the entire multifamily dwelling (e.g., an entire apartment building or housing complex), is not secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § <ref target="1003-2-n" reftype="internal">1003.2(n)</ref>. For example, assume that an investor purchases 10 individual unit condominiums in a 100-unit condominium complex using a covered loan. The covered loan would not be secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § <ref target="1003-2-n" reftype="internal">1003.2(n)</ref>. In both of these situations, a financial institution reporting a covered loan or application secured by these separate dwellings would not be subject to the additional reporting requirements for covered loans secured by or applications proposed to be secured by multifamily dwellings under § <ref target="1003-4-a-32" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(32)</ref>.

                <content>Section <ref target="1003-3-c-13" reftype="internal">1003.3(c)(13)</ref> provides an exclusion for a transaction that provided or, in the case of an application, proposed to provide new funds to the borrower in advance of being consolidated in a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255 (New York CEMA) and for which final action is taken on both transactions within the same calendar year. The excluded transaction provides or proposes to provide funds that are not part of any existing debt obligation of the borrower and that are then consolidated or proposed to be consolidated with an existing debt obligation or obligations as part of the supplemental mortgage. The new funds are reported only insofar as they form part of the total amount of the reported New York CEMA, and not as a separate amount. This exclusion applies only if, at the time the transaction that provided new funds was originated, the financial institution intended to consolidate the loan into a New York CEMA. If a New York CEMA that consolidates an excluded preliminary transaction is carried out in a transaction involving an assumption, the financial institution reports the New York CEMA and does not report the preliminary transaction separately. The § <ref target="1003-3-c-13" reftype="internal">1003.3(c)(13)</ref> exclusion does not apply to similar preliminary transactions that provide or propose to provide new funds to be consolidated not pursuant to New York Tax Law section 255 but under some other law in a transaction that is not an extension of credit. For example, assume a financial institution extends new funds to a consumer in a preliminary transaction that is then consolidated as part of a consolidation, extension and modification agreement pursuant to the law of a State other than New York. If the preliminary extension of new funds is a covered loan, it must be reported. If the consolidation, extension and modification agreement pursuant to the law of a State other than New York is not an extension of credit pursuant to Regulation C, it may not be reported.

                <content>In contrast, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>, a purchase does not include a temporary transfer of a <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to an interim funder or warehouse creditor as part of an interim funding agreement under which the originating <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> is obligated to repurchase the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> for sale to a subsequent investor. Such agreements, often referred to as “repurchase agreements,” are sometimes employed as functional equivalents of warehouse lines of credit. Under these agreements, the interim funder or warehouse creditor acquires legal title to the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref>, subject to an obligation of the originating institution to repurchase at a future date, rather than taking a security interest in the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> as under the terms of a more conventional warehouse line of credit. To illustrate, assume <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A has an interim funding agreement with <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to enable <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to originate loans. Assume further that <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B originates a <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> and that, pursuant to this agreement, <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A takes a temporary transfer of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> until <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B arranges for the sale of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to a subsequent investor and that <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B repurchases the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to enable it to complete the sale to the subsequent investor (alternatively, <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A may transfer the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> directly to the subsequent investor at <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B's direction, pursuant to the interim funding agreement). The subsequent investor could be, for example, a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> or other entity that intends to hold the loan in portfolio, a GSE or other securitizer, or a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> or other entity that intends to package and sell multiple loans to a GSE or other securitizer. In this example, the temporary transfer of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> from <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A is not a purchase, and any subsequent transfer back to <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B for delivery to the subsequent investor is not a purchase, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>. <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B reports the origination of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> as well as its sale to the subsequent investor. If the subsequent investor is a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="internal">1003.2(g)</ref>, it reports a purchase of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> pursuant to § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>, regardless of whether it acquired the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> from <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B or directly from <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A.</content>

                  <content>If a financial institution has previously assigned a covered loan with a ULI or reported a covered loan with a ULI under this part, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned or reported. For example, if a loan origination previously was reported under this part with a ULI, the financial institution that purchases the covered loan would report the purchase of the covered loan using the same ULI. A financial institution that purchases a covered loan must use the ULI that was assigned by the financial institution that originated the covered loan. A financial institution that purchases a covered loan assigns a ULI and records and submits it in its loan/application register pursuant to § <ref target="1003-5-a-1" reftype="internal">1003.5(a)(1)</ref> if the covered loan was not assigned a ULI by the financial institution that originated the loan because, for example, the loan was originated prior to January 1, 2018, or the loan was originated by an institution not required to report under this part.</content>

For purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>, a property is an investment property if the borrower does not, or the applicant will not, occupy the property. For example, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and generates income by renting the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>. Similarly, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and does not generate income by renting the property, but intends to generate income by selling the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>. Section <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref> requires a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> to identify a property as an investment property if the borrower or applicant does not or will not occupy the property, even if the borrower or applicant does not consider the property as owned for investment purposes.

If the property is for transitory use by employees, the property would not be considered a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="internal">1003.2(f)</ref>.

If an institution relies on only a portion of an applicant's income in its determination, it does not report that portion of income not relied on. For example, if an institution, pursuant to lender and investor guidelines, does not rely on an applicant's commission income because it has been earned for less than 12 months, the institution does not include the applicant's commission income in the income reported. Likewise, if an institution relies on the verified gross income of the applicant in making the credit decision, then the institution reports the verified gross income. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes the cosigner's income to the extent relied upon.

The Bureau calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (see 12 CFR 1026.22 and 12 CFR part 1026, appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from the creditor data described in comment 4(a)(12)-1. The Bureau uses loan pricing terms available in the creditor data and other information to estimate annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which the creditor data are limited or not available. The Bureau publishes on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates. A financial institution may either use the average prime offer rates published by the Bureau or determine average prime offer rates itself by employing the methodology published on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site.

However, if the financial institution changes the promised rate to the rate that would have been available to the borrower under the new program on the date of the original rate-lock commitment, then that is the date the rate is set, provided the financial institution consistently follows that practice in all such cases or the original rate-lock agreement so provided. For example, assume that a borrower locks a rate of 2.5 percent on June 1 for a 30-year, variable-rate loan with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory period. On June 15, the borrower decides to switch to a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, and the rate available to the borrower for that product on June 15 is 4.0 percent. On June 1, the 30-year, fixed-rate loan would have been available to the borrower at a rate of 3.5 percent. If the financial institution offers the borrower the 3.5 percent rate (i.e., the rate that would have been available to the borrower for the fixed-rate product on June 1, the date of the original rate-lock) because the original agreement so provided or because the financial institution consistently follows that practice for borrowers who change loan programs, then the financial institution should use June 1 as the rate-set date.

                <content>Indirect land ownership can occur when the applicant or borrower is or will be a member of a resident-owned community structured as a housing cooperative in which the occupants own an entity that holds the underlying land of the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community. In such communities, the applicant or borrower may still have a lease and pay rent for the lot on which his or her <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> is or will be located, but the property interest type for such an arrangement should be reported as indirect ownership if the applicant is or will be a member of the cooperative that owns the underlying land of the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community.

                <content>A leasehold interest could be formalized in a lease with a defined term and specified rent payments, or could arise as a tenancy at will through permission of a land owner without any written, formal arrangement. For example, assume a borrower will locate the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> in a <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community, has a written lease for a lot in that park, and the lease specifies rent payments.

To be covered by the definition in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>, a system must be an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or a Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has securitized, provided Federal government insurance, or provided a Federal government guarantee for a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit at any point in time. A person may be a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> even if it is not actively securitizing, insuring, or guaranteeing closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit at the time a financial institution uses the AUS to evaluate an application. Where the person that developed the electronic tool has never been a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, at the time a financial institution uses the tool to evaluate an application, the financial institution complies with § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> by reporting that the requirement is not applicable because an AUS was not used to evaluate the application. If a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is also a securitizer, then the financial institution complies with § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. On the other hand, if a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is not a securitizer, then the financial institution is not required by § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> to report the use of that system and the result generated by that system. In addition, for an AUS to be covered by the definition in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>, the system must provide a result regarding both the credit risk of the applicant and the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used to evaluate the application. For example, if a system is an electronic tool that provides a determination of the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used by a financial institution to evaluate the application, but the system does not also provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of the applicant—such as an evaluation of the applicant's income, debt, and credit history—then that system does not qualify as an AUS, as defined in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>. A financial institution that uses a system that is not an AUS, as defined in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>, to evaluate an application does not report the information required by § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-i" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(i)</ref>.</content>

A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has ever securitized, insured, or guaranteed a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit. If a financial institution knows or reasonably believes that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, then the financial institution complies with § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. Knowledge or reasonable belief could, for example, be based on a sales agreement or other related documents, the financial institution's previous transactions or relationship with the developer of the electronic tool, or representations made by the developer of the electronic tool demonstrating that the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. If a financial institution does not know or reasonably believe that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, the financial institution complies with § <ref target="1003-4-a-35" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)</ref> by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, provided that the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to determine whether the electronic tool it is using to evaluate an application meets the definition in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>.
