              <content>Race—Aggregate categories and subcategories. There are five aggregate race categories: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and White. The Asian and the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate categories have seven and four subcategories, respectively. The Asian race subcategories are: Asian Indian; Chinese, Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian. The Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander race subcategories are: Native Hawaiian; Guamanian or Chamorro; Samoan; and Other Pacific Islander. You must report every aggregate race category selected by the applicant. If the applicant also selects one or more race subcategories, you must report each race subcategory selected by the applicant, except that you must not report more than a total of five aggregate race categories and race subcategories combined. For example, if the applicant selects all five aggregate race categories and also selects some race subcategories, you report only the five aggregate race categories. On the other hand, if the applicant selects the White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate race categories, and the applicant also selects the Korean, Vietnamese, and Samoan race subcategories, you must report White, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and any two, at your option, of the three race subcategories selected by the applicant. In this example, you must report White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and in addition you must report (at your option) either Korean and Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan, or Vietnamese and Samoan. To determine how to report an Other race subcategory for purposes of the five-race maximum, see paragraph <ref target="1003-B-1-9-iv" reftype="internal">9.iv</ref> below.</content>

In either such case, you must report both the selection of Other Asian or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable, and the additional information provided by the applicant, subject to the five-race maximum. In all such cases where the applicant has selected an Other race subcategory and also provided additional information, for purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined set forth above, the Other race subcategory and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection. Thus, using the same facts in the example offered in paragraph <ref target="1003-B-1-9-iii" reftype="internal">9.iii</ref> above, if the applicant also selected Other Asian and entered “Thai” in the space provided, Other Asian and Thai are considered one selection.

              <content>A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="term">request for preapproval</ref>) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective loan applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> process; others use the same process.

These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home. Regardless of its name, a program that satisfies the definition of a preapproval program in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. Conversely, a program that a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> describes as a “preapproval program” that does not satisfy the requirements of § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref> is not a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. If a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> does not regularly use the procedures specified in § <ref target="1003-2-b-2" reftype="internal">1003.2(b)(2)</ref>, but instead considers requests for preapprovals on an ad hoc basis, the <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> need not treat ad hoc requests as part of a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. A <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> should, however, be generally consistent in following uniform procedures for considering such ad hoc requests.</content>

              <content>. Section <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> defines a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> as an extension of credit that is secured by a lien on a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> and that is not an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="internal">1003.2(o)</ref>. Thus, for example, a loan to purchase a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> and secured only by a personal guarantee is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> because it is not <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>-secured.</content>

              <content>Under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref>, a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>-secured loan is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> unless it involves an extension of credit. Thus, some transactions completed pursuant to installment sales contracts, such as some land contracts, are not <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loans</ref> because no credit is extended. For example, if a land contract provides that, upon default, the contract terminates, all previous payments will be treated as rent, and the borrower is under no obligation to make further payments, the transaction is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref>. In general, extension of credit under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> refers to the granting of credit only pursuant to a new debt obligation. Thus, except as described in comments 2(d)-2.i and .ii, if a transaction modifies, renews, extends, or amends the terms of an existing debt obligation, but the existing debt obligation is not satisfied and replaced, the transaction is not a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="internal">1003.2(d)</ref> because there has been no new extension of credit.

For example, a <ref target="1003-2-d" reftype="term">closed-end mortgage loan</ref> obtained to repair a <ref target="1003-2-f" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> by replacing a roof is a <ref target="1003-2-i" reftype="term">home improvement loan</ref> under § <ref target="1003-2-i" reftype="internal">1003.2(i)</ref>.

In this example, the transaction is an <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="term">open-end line of credit</ref> under Regulation C, provided the other requirements of § <ref target="1003-2-o" reftype="internal">1003.2(o)</ref> are met.</content>

                <content>In contrast, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>, a purchase does not include a temporary transfer of a <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to an interim funder or warehouse creditor as part of an interim funding agreement under which the originating <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> is obligated to repurchase the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> for sale to a subsequent investor. Such agreements, often referred to as “repurchase agreements,” are sometimes employed as functional equivalents of warehouse lines of credit. Under these agreements, the interim funder or warehouse creditor acquires legal title to the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref>, subject to an obligation of the originating institution to repurchase at a future date, rather than taking a security interest in the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> as under the terms of a more conventional warehouse line of credit. To illustrate, assume <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A has an interim funding agreement with <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to enable <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to originate loans.

The subsequent investor could be, for example, a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> or other entity that intends to hold the loan in portfolio, a GSE or other securitizer, or a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> or other entity that intends to package and sell multiple loans to a GSE or other securitizer. In this example, the temporary transfer of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> from <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B to <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> A is not a purchase, and any subsequent transfer back to <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B for delivery to the subsequent investor is not a purchase, for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)</ref>. <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">Financial Institution</ref> B reports the origination of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> as well as its sale to the subsequent investor.

For purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>, a property is an investment property if the borrower does not, or the applicant will not, occupy the property. For example, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and generates income by renting the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>. Similarly, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and does not generate income by renting the property, but intends to generate income by selling the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § <ref target="1003-4-a-6" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(6)</ref>.

For example, if an institution relies on an applicant's salary to compute a debt-to-income ratio but also relies on the applicant's annual bonus to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution reports the salary and the bonus to the extent relied upon. If an institution relies on only a portion of an applicant's income in its determination, it does not report that portion of income not relied on. For example, if an institution, pursuant to lender and investor guidelines, does not rely on an applicant's commission income because it has been earned for less than 12 months, the institution does not include the applicant's commission income in the income reported. Likewise, if an institution relies on the verified gross income of the applicant in making the credit decision, then the institution reports the verified gross income. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes the cosigner's income to the extent relied upon.

                <content>Indirect land ownership can occur when the applicant or borrower is or will be a member of a resident-owned community structured as a housing cooperative in which the occupants own an entity that holds the underlying land of the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community. In such communities, the applicant or borrower may still have a lease and pay rent for the lot on which his or her <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> is or will be located, but the property interest type for such an arrangement should be reported as indirect ownership if the applicant is or will be a member of the cooperative that owns the underlying land of the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community.

                <content>A leasehold interest could be formalized in a lease with a defined term and specified rent payments, or could arise as a tenancy at will through permission of a land owner without any written, formal arrangement. For example, assume a borrower will locate the <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> in a <ref target="1003-2-l" reftype="term">manufactured home</ref> community, has a written lease for a lot in that park, and the lease specifies rent payments.

In addition, in order for an AUS to be covered by the definition in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>, the system must provide a result regarding both the credit risk of the applicant and the eligibility of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used to evaluate the <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref>. For example, if a system is an electronic tool that provides a determination of the eligibility of the <ref target="1003-2-e" reftype="term">covered loan</ref> to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used by a <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> to evaluate the <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref>, but the system does not also provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of the applicant—such as, an evaluation of the applicant's income, debt, and credit history—then that system does not qualify as an AUS, as defined in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>. A <ref target="1003-2-g" reftype="term">financial institution</ref> that uses a system that is not an AUS, as defined in § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-ii" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(ii)</ref>, to evaluate an <ref target="1003-2-b" reftype="term">application</ref> does not report the information required by § <ref target="1003-4-a-35-i" reftype="internal">1003.4(a)(35)(i)</ref>.</content>
