Procedures reasonably adapted to avoid <ref target="1005-11-a-1" reftype="term">error</ref> will depend upon the circumstances. Generally, requesting the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to specify whether the card to be used for the authorization is a debit (or check) card or a <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> card is a reasonable procedure. Where the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has indicated that the card is a <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> card (or that the card is not a debit or check card), the payee may rely on the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s statement without seeking further information about the type of card. If the payee believes, at the time of the authorization, that a <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> card is involved, and later finds that the card used is a debit card (for example, because the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> later brings the matter to the payee's attention), the payee must obtain a written and signed or (where appropriate) a similarly authenticated authorization as soon as reasonably possible, or cease debiting the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref>.</content>

Section <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> applies, for example, to an <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> number or bar code that can be used to access underlying funds. Similarly, § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> applies to a device with a chip or other embedded mechanism that links the device to stored funds, such as a mobile phone or sticker containing a contactless chip that enables the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to access the stored funds. A card, code, or other device that meets the definition in §§ <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="internal">1005.20(a)(1)</ref> through <ref target="1005-20-a-3" reftype="internal">(a)(3)</ref> includes an electronic promise (see comment <ref target="1005-20-a-Interp-2" reftype="internal">20(a)-2</ref>) as well as a promise that is not electronic. See, however, § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref>.

Thus, for example, if a merchant emails a code that a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may redeem in a specified amount either online or in the merchant's store, that code is covered under § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, unless one of the exclusions in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> apply.</content>

              <content>Electronic promise. The term “electronic promise” as used in EFTA sections 915(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D) means a <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref>'s commitment or obligation communicated or stored in electronic form made to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to provide payment for goods or services for transactions initiated by the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

For example, if a merchant issues a code that can be given as a gift and that entitles the recipient to redeem the code in an online transaction for goods or services, that code represents an electronic promise by the merchant and is a card, code, or other device covered by § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>.</content>

Certain cards, codes, or other devices may be redeemable upon presentation for a specific good or service, or “experience,” such as a spa treatment, hotel stay, or airline flight. In other cases, a card, code, or other device may entitle the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to a certain percentage off the purchase of a good or service, such as 20% off of any purchase in a store. Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> “in a specified amount” as required under the definitions of “<ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>,” “<ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift card</ref>,” or “<ref target="1005-20-a-3" reftype="term">general-use prepaid card</ref>.” However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> apply.

Section <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> only applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are sold or issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A card, code, or other device initially purchased by a business is subject to this section if the card, code, or other device is purchased for redistribution or resale to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Moreover, the fact that a card, code, or other device may be primarily funded by a business, for example, in the case of certain rewards or incentive cards, does not mean the card, code, or other device is outside the scope of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, if the card, code, or other device will be provided to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. But see § <ref target="1005-20-b-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(3)</ref>. Whether a card, code, or other device is issued to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes will depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a program manager purchases <ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift cards</ref> directly from an issuing merchant and sells those cards through the program manager's retail outlets, such gift cards are subject to the requirements of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> because the <ref target="1005-20-a-2" reftype="term">store gift cards</ref> are sold to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In contrast, a card, code, or other device generally would not be issued to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore would fall outside the scope of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, if the purchaser of the card, code, or device is contractually prohibited from reselling or redistributing the card, code, or device to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and reasonable policies and procedures are maintained to avoid such sale or distribution for such purposes. However, if an entity that has purchased cards, codes, or other devices for business purposes sells or distributes such cards, codes, or other devices to <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that entity does not comply with § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> if it has not otherwise met the substantive and disclosure requirements of the rule or unless an exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)</ref> applies.</content>

              <content>Eligibility for multiple exclusions. A card, code, or other device may qualify for one or more exclusions. For example, a corporation may give its employees a gift card that is marketed solely to businesses for incentive-related purposes, such as to reward job performance or promote employee safety. In this case, the card may qualify for the exclusion for <ref target="1005-20-a-4" reftype="term">loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards</ref> under § <ref target="1005-20-b-3" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(3)</ref>, or for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § <ref target="1005-20-b-4" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(4)</ref>. In addition, as long as any one of the exclusions applies, a card, code, or other device is not covered by § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref>, even if other exclusions do not apply. In the above example, the corporation may give its employees a type of gift card that can also be purchased by a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> directly from a merchant. Under these circumstances, while the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § <ref target="1005-20-b-4" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(4)</ref> because the card can also be obtained through retail channels, it is nevertheless exempt from the substantive requirements of § <ref target="1005-20" reftype="internal">1005.20</ref> because it is a <ref target="1005-20-a-4" reftype="term">loyalty, award, or promotional gift card</ref>.

                <content>Marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. The term “marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>” means directly or indirectly offering, advertising, or otherwise suggesting the potential use of a card, code or other device, as a gift for another <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref>. Whether the exclusion applies generally does not depend on the type of entity that makes the promotional message. For example, a card may be marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> if anyone (other than the purchaser of the card), including the issuer, the retailer, the program manager that may distribute the card, or the payment network on which a card is used, promotes the use of the card as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. A card, code, or other device, including a general-purpose reloadable card, is marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> even if it is only occasionally marketed as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. For example, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card would be marketed or labeled as a gift card or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref> if the issuer principally advertises the card as a less costly alternative to a bank <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> but promotes the card in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. However, the mere mention of the availability of gift cards or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificates</ref> in an advertisement or on a sign that also indicates the availability of other excluded prepaid cards does not by itself cause the excluded prepaid cards to be marketed as a gift card or a <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificate</ref>. For example, the posting of a sign in a store that refers to the availability of gift cards does not by itself constitute the marketing of otherwise excluded prepaid cards that may also be sold in the store as gift cards or <ref target="1005-20-a-1" reftype="term">gift certificates</ref>, provided that a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be led to believe that the sign applies to all prepaid cards sold in the store.

A card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public if the potential use of the card, code, or other device is directly or indirectly offered, advertised, or otherwise promoted to the general public. A card, code, or other device may be marketed to the general public through any advertising medium, including television, radio, newspaper, the Internet, or signage. However, the posting of a company policy that funds may be disbursed by prepaid card (such as a sign posted at a cash register or customer service center stating that store <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> will be issued by prepaid card) does not constitute the marketing of a card, code, or other device to the general public. In addition, the method of distribution by itself is not dispositive in determining whether a card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public. Factors that may be considered in determining whether the exclusion applies to a particular card, code, or other device include the means or channel through which the card, code, or device may be obtained by a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, the subset of <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumers</ref> that are eligible to obtain the card, code, or device, and whether the availability of the card, code, or device is advertised or otherwise promoted in the marketplace.</content>

                <content>Exclusion explained. To qualify for the exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref>, the sole means of issuing the card, code, or other device must be in a paper form. Thus, the exclusion generally applies to certificates issued in paper form where solely the paper itself may be used to purchase goods or services. A card, code or other device is not issued solely in paper form simply because it may be reproduced or printed on paper. For example, a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon electronically provided to a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and redeemable for goods and services is not issued in paper form, even if it may be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. In this circumstance, although the <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> might hold a paper facsimile of the card, code, or other device, the exclusion does not apply because the information necessary to redeem the value was initially issued in electronic form. A paper certificate is within the exclusion regardless of whether it may be redeemed electronically. For example, a paper certificate or receipt that bears a bar code, code, or <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> number falls within the exclusion in § <ref target="1005-20-b-5" reftype="internal">1005.20(b)(5)</ref> if the bar code, code, or <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> number is not issued in any form other than on the paper.

Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for the purposes of this section if they are in a print that contrasts with and is otherwise not obstructed by the background on which they are printed. For example, disclosures on a card or computer screen are not likely to be conspicuous if obscured by a logo printed in the background. Similarly, disclosures on the back of a card that are printed on top of indentations from embossed type on the front of the card are not likely to be conspicuous if the indentations obstruct the readability of the disclosures. To the extent permitted, oral disclosures meet the standard when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a <ref target="1005-2-e" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to hear and comprehend them.</content>

In contrast, the <ref target="1005-30-f" reftype="term">provider</ref> has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the <ref target="1005-30-f" reftype="term">remittance transfer provider</ref> sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref> located in a <ref target="1005-2-l" reftype="term">State</ref>, including the <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref>, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card.</content>

            <content>Electronic transfer of funds. The definition of “<ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>” requires an electronic transfer of funds. The term electronic has the meaning given in section 106(2) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. There may be an electronic transfer of funds if a <ref target="1005-30-f" reftype="term">provider</ref> makes an electronic book entry between different settlement <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref> to effectuate the transfer. However, where a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> mails funds directly to a recipient, or provides funds to a courier for delivery to a foreign country, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Similarly, generally, where a <ref target="1005-30-f" reftype="term">provider</ref> issues a check, draft, or other paper instrument to be mailed to a <ref target="1005-2-j" reftype="term">person</ref> abroad, there is not an electronic transfer of funds.

For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> because these charges are not specifically related to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">Account</ref> fees are also not specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> if such fees are merely assessed based on general <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> activity and not for receiving transfers.  Where an incoming <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the <ref target="1005-30-c" reftype="term">designated recipient</ref> are not fees imposed on the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a <ref target="1005-30-f-1" reftype="term">provider</ref> when a <ref target="1005-30-g" reftype="term">sender</ref> uses a <ref target="1005-2-f" reftype="term">credit</ref> or debit card to pay for a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> is not a fee imposed upon the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Fees that specifically relate to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">account</ref> status or the quantity of <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfers</ref> received) in addition to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> itself.  For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, but not on preferred <ref target="1005-2-b-1" reftype="term">accounts</ref>, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref>.  Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfer</ref> regardless of how many <ref target="1005-30-e-1" reftype="term">remittance transfers</ref> preceded it that month.</content>
