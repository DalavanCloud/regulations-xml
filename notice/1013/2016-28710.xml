    <!-- In supplement I to part 1013, under Section 1013.2—Definitions, -->
    <!-- under 2(e)—Consumer Lease, paragraph 9 is revised, -->

      <interpParagraph label="1013-2-e-Interp-9" marker="9.">
        <title type="keyterm">Threshold amount.</title>
        <content>A <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">consumer lease</ref> is exempt from the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. The threshold amount in effect during a particular time period is the amount stated in comment <ref target="1013-2-e-11" reftype="internal">2(e)-11</ref> for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Comment <ref target="1013-2-e-11" reftype="internal">2(e)-11</ref> will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900. If a <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">consumer lease</ref> is exempt from the requirements of this part because the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the <ref target="1013-2-e-1" reftype="term">lease</ref> remains exempt regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount.</content>

        <content>If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.</content>
