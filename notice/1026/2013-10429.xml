For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> may rely without further inquiry on information provided by applicants in response to a request for “salary,” “income,” “personal income,” “individual income,” “assets,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide information regarding his or her current or reasonably expected income or assets. However, <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuers</ref> may not rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “household income.” Nor may they rely solely on information provided in response to a request for “available income,” “accessible income,” or other language requesting that the applicant provide any income or assets to which the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access. In such cases, the <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> would need to obtain additional information about an applicant's current or reasonably expected income (such as by contacting the applicant).

In both of these circumstances, a <ref target="1026-2-a-7" reftype="term">card issuer</ref> may treat any income and assets to which an applicant, accountholder, joint applicant, cosigner, or guarantor who is or will be liable for debts incurred on the account has a reasonable expectation of access as the applicant's current or reasonably expected income—but is not required to do so.

Although these comments clarify the independent ability-to-pay requirement that governs applications from <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> under 21, they provide guidance regarding the use of “independent income and assets” as an underwriting criterion under § 1026.51(a).

An issuer who chooses to comply with § 1026.51(a) by limiting its consideration to applicants' independent income and assets likewise would not consider income or assets to which applicants 21 or older have only a reasonable expectation of access.</content>

          <content>Current or reasonably expected income includes, for example, current or expected salary, wages, bonus pay, tips, and commissions. Employment may be full-time, part-time, seasonal, irregular, military, or self-employment. Other sources of income include interest or dividends, retirement benefits, public assistance, alimony, child support, and separate maintenance payments. Proceeds from student loans may be considered as current or reasonably expected income only to the extent that those proceeds exceed the amount disbursed or owed to an educational institution for tuition and other expenses. Current or reasonably expected income includes income that is being deposited regularly into an account on which the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is an accountholder (e.g., an individual deposit account or a joint account). Assets include, for example, savings accounts and investments. Current or reasonably expected income and assets does not include income and assets to which the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> only has a reasonable expectation of access.</content>
