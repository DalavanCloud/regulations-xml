Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions.

Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.

              <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</content>

          <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance.

          <content>Under § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>.

            <title type="keyterm">Planned unit developments.</title>
            <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance.

        <content>Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</content>

Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.

            <title>Section 1026.20 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.20(d) to implement the disclosure requirements of TILA sections 129D(j)(1)(B) and 129D(j)(2), as enacted by section 1462 of the Dodd-Frank Act. TILA section 129D(j)(1)(B) requires a creditor or servicer to provide the disclosures set forth in TILA section 129D(j)(2) when a consumer requests closure of an escrow account that was established in connection with a transaction secured by real property. Proposed § 226.20(d) would have directed the creditor or servicer to disclose the information about escrow accounts in accordance with certain format and timing requirements. As previously noted, the Bureau has delayed the implementation of certain disclosure requirements contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those contained in sections 1461 and 1462. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012). Consequently, the Bureau will not be adopting a new § 1026.20(d) in this rule.</analysisParagraph>

            <title>Section 1026.19 Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.19(f) to implement the account disclosure requirements of TILA section 129D, as enacted by Sections 1461 and 1462 of the Dodd- Frank Act. Proposed § 226.19(f)<footnote ref="24">This section-by-section analysis discusses the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal by reference to the Board's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, which the Board proposed to amend, and discusses this final rule by reference to the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, which this final rule amends.</footnote>

            would have required disclosures for the establishment or non-establishment of an escrow account in connection with consummation of a transaction secured by a first lien, but not a subordinate lien. As discussed above, on November 23, 2012, the Bureau published in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> a rule that delays the implementation of certain disclosure requirements contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those contained in sections 1461 and 1462. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012). Consequently, the Bureau will not be adopting a new § 1026.19(f) in this rule.</analysisParagraph>

          <content>A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” Even if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is otherwise eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref>, a first-lien <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is subject to the requirement to establish an escrow account under § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> unless the purchaser is also eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref> or the transaction is otherwise exempt under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)</ref>. The escrow requirement applies to any such transaction, whether the forward commitment provides for the purchase and sale of the specific transaction or for the purchase and sale of mortgage obligations with certain prescribed criteria that the transaction meets.
