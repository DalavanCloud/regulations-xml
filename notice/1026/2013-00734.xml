Under § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>.

If the investor is ineligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref>, an escrow account must be established for the transaction before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> in accordance with § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> unless the transaction is otherwise exempt (such as a reverse mortgage or home equity line of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>).</content>

For purposes of this determination, because only covered transactions are counted, all first-lien originations (and only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as “Not owner-occupied” (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as “Multifamily” (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co-applicant's sex is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 4). The most recent HMDA data are available at http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda.</content>

        <content>Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)</ref>, a county is rural during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. These areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">States</ref> Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Specifically, the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref> classifies a county as “rural” if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12.

Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.

            <content>Construction-permanent loans. Under § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> elects under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. If the transaction is determined to be a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref>, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> to establish and maintain an escrow account, and the period for which the escrow account must remain in place under § <ref target="1026-35-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(3)</ref> is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent phase financing occurs.</content>

Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area.

For purposes of this determination, because only covered transactions are counted, all first-lien originations (and only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as “Not owner-occupied” (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as “Multifamily” (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co-applicant's sex is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 4).

A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” Even if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is otherwise eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref>, a first-lien <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is subject to the requirement to establish an escrow account under § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> unless the purchaser is also eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref> or the transaction is otherwise exempt under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)</ref>.

                <content>Construction-permanent loans. Under § 1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> elects under § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to § <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the <ref target="1026-35-a-2" reftype="term">average prime offer rate</ref> for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> under § <ref target="1026-35-a" reftype="internal">1026.35(a)</ref>. If the transaction is determined to be a <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref>, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> to establish and maintain an escrow account, and the period for which the escrow account must remain in place under § <ref target="1026-35-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(3)</ref> is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent phase financing occurs.</content>

Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance.

For purposes of this determination, because only covered transactions are counted, all first-lien originations (and only first-lien originations) reported in the HMDA data are counted except those for which the owner-occupancy status is reported as “Not owner-occupied” (HMDA code 2), the property type is reported as “Multifamily” (HMDA code 3), the applicant's or co-applicant's race is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 7), or the applicant's or co-applicant's sex is reported as “Not applicable” (HMDA code 4).

          <content>Requirements for “rural” or “underserved” status.

        <content>Planned unit developments. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-ii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(ii)</ref>, if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance.

Section <ref target="1026-35" reftype="internal">1026.35</ref> may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> permits the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. See also comment <ref target="1026-17-c-6-Interp-2" reftype="internal">17(c)(6)-2</ref>. Section <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref> addresses only how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction.

When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with § <ref target="1026-22-a-1" reftype="internal">1026.22(a)(1)</ref> and <ref target="1026-D" reftype="internal">appendix D</ref> to part 1026.

A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” Even if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is otherwise eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref>, a first-lien <ref target="1026-35-a-1" reftype="term">higher-priced mortgage loan</ref> that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is subject to the requirement to establish an escrow account under § <ref target="1026-35-b-1" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(1)</ref> unless the purchaser is also eligible for the exemption in § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iii)</ref> or the transaction is otherwise exempt under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)</ref>.
