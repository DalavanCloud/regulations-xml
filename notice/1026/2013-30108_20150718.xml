          <title type="keyterm">Secured by new manufactured home and land—physical visit of the interior.</title>
          <content>A transaction secured by a new manufactured home and land is subject to the requirements of § 1026.35(c)(3) through (6) except for the requirement in § 1026.35(c)(3)(i) that the appraiser conduct a physical inspection of the interior of the property. Thus, for example, a creditor of a loan secured by a new manufactured home and land could comply with § 1026.35(c)(3)(i) by obtaining an appraisal conducted by a state-certified or -licensed appraiser based on plans and specifications for the new manufactured home and an inspection of the land on which the property will be sited, as well as any other information necessary for the appraiser to complete the appraisal assignment in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and the requirements of FIRREA and any implementing regulations.</content>

            <title type="keyterm">Secured by a manufactured home and not land.</title>
            <content>Section 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B) applies to a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a manufactured home and not land, regardless of whether the home is titled as realty by operation of state law.</content>

              <title type="keyterm">Independent.</title>
              <content>A cost service provider from which the creditor obtains a manufactured home unit cost estimate under § 1026.35(c)(2)(viii)(B)(2) is ‘‘independent’’ if that person is not affiliated with the creditor in the transaction, such as by common corporate ownership, and receives no direct or indirect financial benefits based on whether the transaction is consummated.</content>

              <title type="keyterm">Adjustments.</title>
              <content>The requirement that the cost estimate be from an independent cost service provider does not prohibit a creditor from providing a cost estimate that reflects adjustments to account for factors such as special features, condition or location. However, the requirement that the estimate be obtained from an independent cost service provider means that any adjustments to the estimate must be based on adjustment factors available as part of the independent cost service used, with associated values that are determined by the independent cost service.</content>
