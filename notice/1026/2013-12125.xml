            <title>Section 1026.20 Subsequent Disclosure Requirements</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.20(d) to implement the disclosure requirements of TILA sections 129D(j)(1)(B) and 129D(j)(2), as enacted by section 1462 of the Dodd-Frank Act. TILA section 129D(j)(1)(B) requires a creditor or servicer to provide the disclosures set forth in TILA section 129D(j)(2) when a consumer requests closure of an escrow account that was established in connection with a transaction secured by real property. Proposed § 226.20(d) would have directed the creditor or servicer to disclose the information about escrow accounts in accordance with certain format and timing requirements. As previously noted, the Bureau has delayed the implementation of certain disclosure requirements contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those contained in sections 1461 and 1462. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012). Consequently, the Bureau will not be adopting a new § 1026.20(d) in this rule.</analysisParagraph>

        <content>Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)</ref>, a county is rural during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. These areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Accordingly, for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), “adjacent” has the meaning applied by the USDA-ERS in determining a county's UIC; as so applied, “adjacent” entails a county not only being physically contiguous with a metropolitan statistical area but also meeting certain minimum population commuting patterns. Specifically, a county is “rural” if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Descriptions of UICs are available on the USDA-ERS Web site at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx. A county for which there is no currently applicable UIC (because the county has been created since the USDA-ERS last categorized counties) is rural only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken are themselves rural under currently applicable UICs.</content>

            <title>Section 1026.19 Certain Mortgage and Variable-Rate Transactions</title>
            <analysisParagraph>In the 2011 Escrows Proposal, the Board proposed a new § 226.19(f) to implement the account disclosure requirements of TILA section 129D, as enacted by Sections 1461 and 1462 of the Dodd- Frank Act. Proposed § 226.19(f)<footnote ref="24">This section-by-section analysis discusses the Board's 2011 Escrows Proposal by reference to the Board's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226, which the Board proposed to amend, and discusses this final rule by reference to the Bureau's Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, which this final rule amends.</footnote>

            would have required disclosures for the establishment or non-establishment of an escrow account in connection with consummation of a transaction secured by a first lien, but not a subordinate lien. As discussed above, on November 23, 2012, the Bureau published in the <em data-original="E-04">Federal Register</em> a rule that delays the implementation of certain disclosure requirements contained in title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those contained in sections 1461 and 1462. <em data-original="E-03">See</em> 77 FR 70105 (Nov. 23, 2012). Consequently, the Bureau will not be adopting a new § 1026.19(f) in this rule.</analysisParagraph>

          <content>Under § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)</ref>, a county is rural during a calendar year if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area nor in a micropolitan statistical area that is adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area. These areas are defined by the Office of Management and Budget and applied under currently applicable Urban Influence Codes (UICs), established by the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS). Accordingly, for purposes of § 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), “adjacent” has the meaning applied by the USDA-ERS in determining a county's UIC; as so applied, “adjacent” entails a county not only being physically contiguous with a metropolitan statistical area but also meeting certain minimum population commuting patterns. Specifically, a county is “rural” if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Descriptions of UICs are available on the USDA-ERS Web site at http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx. A county for which there is no currently applicable UIC (because the county has been created since the USDA-ERS last categorized counties) is rural only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken are themselves rural under currently applicable UICs.</content>

The procedures for verifying repayment ability are required under paragraph <ref target="1026-34-a-4-ii" reftype="internal">34(a)(4)(ii)</ref>; the other procedures are not required but, if followed along with the required procedures, create a presumption that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has complied with § <ref target="1026-34-a-4" reftype="internal">1026.34(a)(4)</ref>.

            <title>36(h) Prohibition on Mandatory Arbitration Clauses and Waivers of Certain Consumer Rights</title>
            <analysisParagraph>Section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act added TILA section 129C(e)(1), which prohibits a closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling or an extension of open-end consumer credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling from containing terms that require arbitration or any other non-judicial procedure as the method for resolving disputes arising out of the transaction. TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that, subject to TILA section 129C(e)(3) a consumer and creditor or any assignee may nonetheless agree, after a dispute arises, to use arbitration or other non-judicial procedure to resolve the dispute. The statute further provides in section 129C(e)(3) that no covered transaction secured by a dwelling, and no related agreement between the consumer and creditor, may be applied or interpreted to bar a consumer from bringing a claim in court in connection with any alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau proposed § 1026.36(h) to implement these statutory provisions, pursuant to TILA section 105(a) and section 1022(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Proposed § 1026.36(h)(2) would have clarified the interaction between TILA sections 129C(e)(2) and (e)(3), and the section-by-section analysis noted that TILA section 129C(e)(3) and § 1026.36(h)(2) do not address State law causes of action.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Commenters generally supported the proposal. Although some commenters addressed details of the substance of the proposal, many commenters addressed the timing of the provisions' implementation. For example, several consumer groups stated that the proposal did not make any substantive changes to the statutory provisions and should be withdrawn because there was no reason to delay the effective date of the statutory provisions. One commenter acknowledged that the provisions were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act but urged the Bureau to encourage mandatory arbitration anyway. SBA Advocacy stated that some Small Entity Representatives did not understand why the provisions were being included in this rule and asked the Bureau to consider adopting it at a later date. A bank association commenter urged the Bureau to delay the provisions until after it completed its required general study of arbitration clauses in consumer transactions, pursuant to section 1028 of the Dodd-Frank Act.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>One commenter requested clarification on whether the provisions apply to waivers of rights to a jury trial. Other commenters questioned variously whether the proposal altered the statutory provisions: By applying the provision on waivers of causes of action to post-dispute agreements; by applying that provision to loans other than residential mortgage loans and open-end consumer credit plans secured by a principal dwelling; by limiting it to Federal causes of action; or by prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts and agreements other than the note and agreements related to the note. One commenter stated that the applicability of the proposed rule provisions was confusing because the provisions refer to consumer transactions secured by a dwelling but their scope is also addressed separately in proposed § 1026.36(j). (Proposed § 1026.36(j) is finalized as § 1026.36(b) of the rule.) Finally, one commenter suggested that the statute and the rule would prohibit nonjudicial foreclosures and prevent a servicer from settling a dispute with a consumer through a settlement agreement.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The provisions on mandatory arbitration and waiver are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent action by the Bureau, they would take effect on January 21, 2013. The Bureau believes that it is necessary and appropriate to provide implementing language to facilitate compliance with the statute. At the same time, the Bureau recognizes the point made by several commenters regarding the importance of these consumer protections. The fact that the Bureau is implementing the provisions by regulation does not require the Bureau to delay the provisions' effective date for an extended period, as the commenters may have assumed. Instead, the Bureau is providing an effective date of June 1, 2013. The Bureau believes this effective date will give consumers the benefit of these statutory protections within a short timeframe, while also providing industry time to adjust its systems and practices. The Bureau does not believe that industry needs a longer period because the prohibitions on mandatory arbitration agreements and waivers of Federal claims have been known since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, and this final rule will not require extensive changes to origination systems. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not accept loans that require arbitration or other nonjudicial procedures to resolve disputes, so the Bureau believes this aspect of the statute and final rule will not necessitate significant changes to current practices in most circumstances. The Bureau is not providing that the provision become effective immediately, however, in order to provide industry a short period to make any needed adjustments.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>In response to the comments, the Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit waivers of rights to a jury trial because bench trials are judicial procedures, not nonjudicial procedures. The Bureau does not interpret TILA section 129C(e)(1) to limit deeds of trust providing for nonjudicial foreclosure because such instruments are not agreements to use nonjudicial procedures to resolve controversies or settle claims arising out of the transaction, in contrast with agreements to use arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. Nor does the Bureau interpret TILA section 129C(e)(3) to limit nonjudicial foreclosures because nonjudicial foreclosures still allow consumers to bring actions in court alleging violations of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Similarly, the Bureau does not interpret the statute to bar settlement agreements. Such a result would be a highly unusual—perhaps unprecedented—prohibition, and the Bureau believes that Congress would have spoken expressly about settlement agreements if that was the result it intended.<footnote ref="157">&lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;See, e.g., Robinson&lt;/em&gt; v. &lt;em data-original="E-03"&gt;Shelby Cnty. Bd. of Educ.,&lt;/em&gt; 566 F.3d 642, 648 (6th Cir. 2009) (&amp;#8220;[I]t is also well-established that `[p]ublic policy strongly favors settlement of disputes without litigation. * * * Settlement agreements should therefore be upheld whenever equitable and policy considerations so permit.'&amp;#8221;).</footnote>
            Instead, the Bureau reads the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to settle the dispute or claim, the settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring that dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. Accordingly, the Bureau is revising the regulatory text to clarify that § 1026.36(h) does not limit a consumer and creditor or any assignee from agreeing, after a dispute or claim under the transaction arises, to settle that dispute or claim. Under TILA section 129C(e)(3) and § 1026.36(h)(2), however, no settlement agreement may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau is further revising the regulatory text to address the belief of some commenters that the Bureau had altered the scope of the statutory provision. As discussed above, TILA section 129C(e)(2) provides that the exception for post-dispute agreements from the prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements is itself subject to the prohibition on waivers of rights to bring Federal causes of action in court. The proposal specified that a post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure could not limit the ability of the consumer to bring a covered claim through the agreed-upon procedure. This final rule clarifies that, consistent with the discussion of waivers of causes of action in settlement agreements above, the Bureau interprets the statute to mean that if a consumer and creditor or assignee agree, after a dispute or claim arises, to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure to resolve that dispute or claim, the agreement may be applied or interpreted to waive the consumer's right to bring <em data-original="E-03">that</em> dispute or claim in court, even if it is a Federal law claim. The Bureau believes that, in such an instance, the consumer is aware of the specific dispute or claim at issue and is therefore in a better position to make a knowing decision whether to resolve the dispute or claim without bringing an action in court. But no post-dispute agreement to use arbitration or other nonjudicial procedure may be applied or interpreted to bar the consumer from bringing an action in court for any other alleged violation of Federal law.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau disagrees with commenters who stated it had expanded the scope of TILA section 129C(e) to cover open-end consumer credit plans other than those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. Proposed § 1026.36(j) (implemented in this final rule as § 1026.36(b)) clarifies the scope of each of the other substantive paragraphs in § 1026.36 and provides that the only open-end consumer credit plans to which § 1026.36(h) applies are those secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. However, to reduce uncertainty, the Bureau is including a statement in § 1026.36(h) that it is applicable to “a home equity line of credit secured by the consumer's principal dwelling.”</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>The Bureau also disagrees that the proposed language changed the scope of the prohibition on waivers of causes of action by including the word “Federal” in the paragraph (h)(2) heading, “No waivers of Federal statutory causes of action.” The contents of paragraph (h)(2) and the corresponding statutory paragraph (e)(3) both provide that the prohibition applies to alleged violations of Section 129C of TILA, any other provision of TILA, or any other Federal law. Thus, the scope of the statutory prohibition is limited to Federal law, and the implementing regulation is properly so limited.</analysisParagraph>
            <analysisParagraph>Finally, the Bureau disagrees that the prohibition on agreements to use mandatory arbitration applies only to the note itself. TILA section 129C(e)(1) provides that it applies to the terms of a residential mortgage loan and to an extension of credit under an open-end consumer credit plan secured by the principal dwelling of the consumer. The terms of such transactions are frequently memorialized in multiple documents. Plainly, the prohibition cannot be evaded simply by including a provision for mandatory arbitration in a document other than the note if that document is executed as part of the transaction. The prohibition applies to the terms of the whole transaction, regardless of which particular document contains those terms. However, to prevent any misunderstanding that the prohibition applies to agreements that are not part of the credit transaction, the Bureau is replacing the phrase “contract or agreement in connection with a” consumer credit transaction with the phrase “contract or other agreement for” a consumer credit transaction.</analysisParagraph>
