          <content>Assume that, in a given calendar year, a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> employee $40,000 in salary and $125,000 in commissions, and makes a contribution of $15,000 to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s 401(k) plan. At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations. Assume that the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref>. In this example, the performance bonus would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref>' transactions as described in § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(i)</ref>, because it is being funded out of a profit pool derived in part from mortgage originations. Thus, the bonus is permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> if it does not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, which in this example consists of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s salary, commissions, contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> elects to include the contribution in calculating total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>), and the performance bonus. Therefore, if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> elects to include the 401(k) contribution in total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for these purposes, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a performance bonus of up to $20,000 (i.e., 10 percent of $200,000 in total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>); if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> does not include the 401(k) contribution in calculating total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, the bonus may be up to $18,333.33.</content>

Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. At the end of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> two bonuses: a “performance” bonus based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end “holiday” bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool. Because the performance bonus is paid out of a bonus pool that is determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, it is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits, and the bonus is therefore subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. If the company-wide bonus pool from which the “holiday” bonus is paid is derived in part from profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit, then the combination of the “holiday” bonus and the performance bonus are subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. The “holiday” bonus is not subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit if the bonus pool is determined with reference only to the profits of business units other than the mortgage origination business unit, as determined in accordance with reasonable accounting principles. If the “performance” bonus and the “holiday” bonus in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, the bonuses may be paid under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> without the necessity of determining from which bonus pool they were paid or whether they were determined with reference to the profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit.</content>

Thus, the awarding of stock, stock options, or equity interests to <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originators</ref> is subject to the restrictions in § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may not award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> based on the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> transaction subject to § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref> originated by that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, bona fide returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including those paid to owners or shareholders of a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> who own such stock or equity interests, are not <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. Bona fide returns or dividends are those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent to <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s respective capital contribution where the allocation is not a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on terms of a transaction. Ownership and equity interests also are not bona fide if the formation or maintenance of the business from which returns or dividends are paid is a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of a transaction. For example, assume that three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> form a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> that is a limited liability company (LLC). The three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> are members of the LLC, and the LLC agreement governing the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref>'s structure calls for regular distributions based on the members' respective equity interests. If the members' respective equity interests are allocated based on the members' terms of transactions, rather than according to their respective capital contributions, then distributions based on such equity interests are not bona fide and, thus, are <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>.</content>

However, the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that secures the financing does not constitute evidence of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. In considering these and other potential sources of income to determine in good faith that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has a reasonable ability to repay the obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making that determination may rely on copies of tax returns the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> filed with the Internal Revenue Service or a <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> taxing authority.</content>

        <content>Time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined. Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

Thus, the awarding of stock, stock options, or equity interests to <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originators</ref> is subject to the restrictions in § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may not award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> based on the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> transaction subject to § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref> originated by that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, bona fide returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including those paid to owners or shareholders of a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> who own such stock or equity interests, are not <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. Bona fide returns or dividends are those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent to <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s respective capital contribution where the allocation is not a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on terms of a transaction. Ownership and equity interests also are not bona fide if the formation or maintenance of the business from which returns or dividends are paid is a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of a transaction. For example, assume that three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> form a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> that is a limited liability company (LLC).

If the members' respective equity interests are allocated based on the members' terms of transactions, rather than according to their respective capital contributions, then distributions based on such equity interests are not bona fide and, thus, are <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>.</content>

See § <ref target="1026-2-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.2(b)(3)</ref>. The parties do not have to agree specifically that the payments will be used to pay for the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, but just that the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> will make a payment to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> toward the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s costs of the transaction, or “closing costs” and the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> retains such payment. For example, assume that a non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller (that is not the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) has an agreement with the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay $1,000 of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs on a transaction. Any of the $1,000 that is paid by the non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> and constitutes “<ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)(3)</ref> to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, even if the agreement does not specify that some or all of $1,000 must be used to compensate the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. Nonetheless, payments by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may not award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> based on the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> transaction subject to § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref> originated by that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, bona fide returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including those paid to owners or shareholders of a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> who own such stock or equity interests, are not <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. Bona fide returns or dividends are those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent to <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s respective capital contribution where the allocation is not a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on terms of a transaction.

For example, assume that three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> form a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> that is a limited liability company (LLC).

If the members' respective equity interests are allocated based on the members' terms of transactions, rather than according to their respective capital contributions, then distributions based on such equity interests are not bona fide and, thus, are <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

            <content>Assume that, in a given calendar year, a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> employee $40,000 in salary and $125,000 in commissions, and makes a contribution of $15,000 to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s 401(k) plan. At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations. Assume that the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref>. In this example, the performance bonus would be directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref>' transactions as described in § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(i)</ref>, because it is being funded out of a profit pool derived in part from mortgage originations. Thus, the bonus is permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> if it does not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, which in this example consists of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s salary, commissions, contribution to the 401(k) plan (if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> elects to include the contribution in calculating total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>), and the performance bonus. Therefore, if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> elects to include the 401(k) contribution in total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for these purposes, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a performance bonus of up to $20,000 (i.e., 10 percent of $200,000 in total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>); if the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> does not include the 401(k) contribution in calculating total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, the bonus may be up to $18,333.33.</content>

Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. At the end of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> two bonuses: a “performance” bonus based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end “holiday” bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool. Because the performance bonus is paid out of a bonus pool that is determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, it is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits, and the bonus is therefore subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. If the company-wide bonus pool from which the “holiday” bonus is paid is derived in part from profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit, then the combination of the “holiday” bonus and the performance bonus are subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. The “holiday” bonus is not subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit if the bonus pool is determined with reference only to the profits of business units other than the mortgage origination business unit, as determined in accordance with reasonable accounting principles. If the “performance” bonus and the “holiday” bonus in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, the bonuses may be paid under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> without the necessity of determining from which bonus pool they were paid or whether they were determined with reference to the profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit.</content>

Such payments to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> are considered <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d-2" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(2)</ref> if they are made pursuant to an agreement between the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> other than the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or its <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliates</ref>. <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> law determines whether there is an agreement between the parties. See § <ref target="1026-2-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.2(b)(3)</ref>. The parties do not have to agree specifically that the payments will be used to pay for the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, but just that the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> will make a payment to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> toward the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s costs of the transaction, or “closing costs” and the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> retains such payment. For example, assume that a non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller (that is not the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>) has an agreement with the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay $1,000 of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs on a transaction. Any of the $1,000 that is paid by the non-<ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> seller to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> and constitutes “<ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)(3)</ref> to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, even if the agreement does not specify that some or all of $1,000 must be used to compensate the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. Nonetheless, payments by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. See comment <ref target="1026-36-d-2-i-Interp-2-i" reftype="internal">36(d)(2)(i)-2.i</ref>. Accordingly, payments in the transaction to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> on behalf of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> by a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> other than the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or its <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliates</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.</content>

            <content>Financial responsibility, character, and general fitness. The determination of financial responsibility, character, and general fitness required under § <ref target="1026-36-f-3-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)(3)(ii)(B)</ref> requires an assessment of all information obtained pursuant to paragraph <ref target="1026-36-f-3-i" reftype="internal">(f)(3)(i)</ref> and any other reasonably available information, including information that is known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> or would become known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> as part of a reasonably prudent hiring process. The absence of any significant adverse information is sufficient to support an affirmative determination that the individual meets the standards. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, the existence of current outstanding judgments, tax liens, other government liens, nonpayment of child support, or a pattern of bankruptcies, foreclosures, or delinquent accounts. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is not required to consider debts arising from medical expenses. A review and assessment of character and general fitness is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">acts</ref> of unfairness or dishonesty, including dishonesty by the individual in the course of seeking employment or in connection with determinations pursuant to the qualification requirements of § <ref target="1026-36-f" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)</ref>, and any disciplinary actions by regulatory or professional licensing agencies. No single factor necessarily requires a determination that the individual does not meet the standards for financial responsibility, character, or general fitness, provided that the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> considers all relevant factors and reasonably determines that, on balance, the individual meets the standards.</content>

Thus, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> and a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> may not agree to set the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> at a certain level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is able to obtain a lower rate from another <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>). When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers to extend <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> with specified terms and conditions (such as the rate and points), the amount of the originator's <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for that transaction is not subject to change (increase or decrease) based on whether different <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms are negotiated. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> agrees to lower the rate that was initially offered, the new offer may not be accompanied by a reduction in the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Thus, while the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may change <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms or pricing to match a competitor, to avoid triggering high-cost mortgage provisions, or for other reasons, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> on that transaction may not be changed for those reasons. A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> therefore may not agree to reduce its <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> or provide a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay a portion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs, for example, to avoid high-cost mortgage provisions. A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may not reduce its own <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in a transaction where the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> receives <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, with or without a corresponding reduction in <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> paid to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>.

        <content><ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">Individual loan originators</ref> who originate ten or fewer mortgage loans. Subject to the conditions in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and (d)(1)(iv)(A), § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) permits <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan even if the payment or contribution is directly or indirectly based on the terms of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref>' transactions if the individual is a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> (as defined in § 1026.36(a)(1)(i)) for ten or fewer transactions during the 12-month period preceding the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> determination. For example, assume a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> employs two <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> who originate transactions subject to § 1026.36 during a given calendar year.

In January of the following calendar year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> formally determines the financial performance of its mortgage business for the prior calendar year. Based on that determination, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> on February 1 decides to pay a bonus to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> out of a company bonus pool. Assume that, between February 1 of the prior calendar year and January 31 of the current calendar year, <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A was the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> for eight transactions, and <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> B was the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> for 15 transactions.

Nonetheless, payments by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

The determination of financial responsibility, character, and general fitness required under § <ref target="1026-36-f-3-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)(3)(ii)(B)</ref> requires an assessment of all information obtained pursuant to paragraph <ref target="1026-36-f-3-i" reftype="internal">(f)(3)(i)</ref> and any other reasonably available information, including information that is known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> or would become known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> as part of a reasonably prudent hiring process. The absence of any significant adverse information is sufficient to support an affirmative determination that the individual meets the standards. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, the existence of current outstanding judgments, tax liens, other government liens, nonpayment of child support, or a pattern of bankruptcies, foreclosures, or delinquent accounts.

        <content>Non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a “non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan” is any <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> arrangement where an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may be paid variable, additional <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based in whole or in part on the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> paying the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, any <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, or a business unit within the organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable (i.e., depending on the level within the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>'s organization at which the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan is established). A non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or other form of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined based upon the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making the contribution, the contribution or benefits are not permitted by § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contribution to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by § 1026.36(d)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, and the amount to be paid out from the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the distributions to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> (e.g., the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may elect not to pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan in a given year), provided the distributions are not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s transactions. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">Compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profitability of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> that performs discrete business functions and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> treats separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that pays its <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> from a source other than a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of transactions of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> under § 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not apply to such bonuses.</content>

The determination of financial responsibility, character, and general fitness required under § <ref target="1026-36-f-3-ii-B" reftype="internal">1026.36(f)(3)(ii)(B)</ref> requires an assessment of all information obtained pursuant to paragraph <ref target="1026-36-f-3-i" reftype="internal">(f)(3)(i)</ref> and any other reasonably available information, including information that is known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> or would become known to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> as part of a reasonably prudent hiring process. The absence of any significant adverse information is sufficient to support an affirmative determination that the individual meets the standards. A review and assessment of financial responsibility is sufficient if it considers, as relevant factors, the existence of current outstanding judgments, tax liens, other government liens, nonpayment of child support, or a pattern of bankruptcies, foreclosures, or delinquent accounts.

Accordingly, the term “mortgage broker” includes companies that engage in the activities described in § <ref target="1026-36-a" reftype="internal">1026.36(a)</ref> and also includes employees of such companies that engage in these activities. Section <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> prohibits certain payments to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>.

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may not award additional stock or a preferable type of equity interest to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> based on the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> transaction subject to § <ref target="1026-36" reftype="internal">1026.36</ref> originated by that <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, bona fide returns or dividends paid on stock or other equity holdings, including those paid to owners or shareholders of a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> who own such stock or equity interests, are not <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for purposes of § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref> and <ref target="1026-36-e" reftype="internal">(e)</ref>. Bona fide returns or dividends are those returns and dividends that are paid pursuant to documented ownership or equity interests and that are not functionally equivalent to <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Ownership and equity interests must be bona fide. Bona fide ownership and equity interests are allocated according to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s respective capital contribution where the allocation is not a mere subterfuge for the payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on terms of a transaction.

For example, assume that three <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> form a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> that is a limited liability company (LLC).

Under § <ref target="1026-36-c-1-i" reftype="internal">1026.36(c)(1)(i)</ref>, a mortgage servicer must <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> a payment to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s loan account as of the date of receipt.

Accordingly, a servicer that receives a payment on or before its due date (or within any grace period), and does not enter the payment on its books or in its system until after the payment's due date (or expiration of any grace period), does not violate this rule as long as the entry does not result in the imposition of a late charge, additional interest, or similar penalty to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, or in the reporting of negative information to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> reporting agency.</content>

A non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or other form of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined based upon the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making the contribution, the contribution or benefits are not permitted by § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contribution to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by § 1026.36(d)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, and the amount to be paid out from the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the distributions to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> (e.g., the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may elect not to pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan in a given year), provided the distributions are not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s transactions. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">Compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profitability of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> that performs discrete business functions and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> treats separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that pays its <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> from a source other than a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of transactions of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> under § 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not apply to such bonuses.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations. Assume that the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> derives revenues from sources other than transactions covered by § <ref target="1026-36-d" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)</ref>.

Section 1026.36 does not limit a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> or other <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> from periodically revising the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> it agrees to pay a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>. However, the revised <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> arrangement must result in payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are not based on the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction.

For example, assume that during the first six months of the year, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays $3,000 to a particular <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> for each loan delivered, regardless of the loan terms or conditions. After considering the volume of business produced by that originator, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could decide that as of July 1, it will pay $3,250 for each loan delivered by that particular originator, regardless of the loan terms or conditions. No violation occurs even if the loans made by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, to reflect the higher <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>.</content>

Nonetheless, payments by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> are not payments to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> that are received directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>.

As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a “non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan” is any <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> arrangement where an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may be paid variable, additional <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based in whole or in part on the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> paying the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, any <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, or a business unit within the organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable (i.e., depending on the level within the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>'s organization at which the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan is established). A non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or other form of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined based upon the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making the contribution, the contribution or benefits are not permitted by § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contribution to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by § 1026.36(d)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, and the amount to be paid out from the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the distributions to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> (e.g., the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may elect not to pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan in a given year), provided the distributions are not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s transactions. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">Compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profitability of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, a business unit is a division, department, or segment within the overall organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> that performs discrete business functions and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> treats separately for accounting or other organizational purposes. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that pays its <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv). A bonus that is paid to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> from a source other than a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, such as a retention bonus budgeted for in advance or a performance bonus paid out of a bonus pool set aside at the beginning of the company's annual accounting period as part of the company's operating budget, does not violate the prohibition on payment of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based on the terms of transactions of multiple <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> under § 1026.36(d)(1)(i), as clarified by comment 36(d)(1)-1.ii; therefore, § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) does not apply to such bonuses.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations.

If the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> intends to make payments with income from employment, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> considers the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s earnings, which may be reflected in payroll statements or earnings statements, IRS Form W-2s or similar IRS forms used for reporting wages or tax withholding, or military Leave and Earnings Statements. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> intends to make payments from other income, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> considers the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s income from sources such as a Federal, <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref>, or local government agency providing benefits and entitlements. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> intends to make payments from income earned from assets, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> considers the relevant assets, such as funds held in accounts with financial institutions, equity ownership interests, or rental property. However, the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that secures the financing does not constitute evidence of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. In considering these and other potential sources of income to determine in good faith that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has a reasonable ability to repay the obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making that determination may rely on copies of tax returns the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> filed with the Internal Revenue Service or a <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> taxing authority.</content>

        <content>Assume that the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during a given calendar year of an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> employed by a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> consists of only salary, commissions, and benefits, and the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> does not participate in a designated defined contribution plan. Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. At the end of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> two bonuses: a “performance” bonus based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end “holiday” bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool. Because the performance bonus is paid out of a bonus pool that is determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, it is <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is determined with reference to mortgage-related business profits, and the bonus is therefore subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. If the company-wide bonus pool from which the “holiday” bonus is paid is derived in part from profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit, then the combination of the “holiday” bonus and the performance bonus are subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit. The “holiday” bonus is not subject to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit if the bonus pool is determined with reference only to the profits of business units other than the mortgage origination business unit, as determined in accordance with reasonable accounting principles. If the “performance” bonus and the “holiday” bonus in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, the bonuses may be paid under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref> without the necessity of determining from which bonus pool they were paid or whether they were determined with reference to the profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s mortgage origination business unit.</content>

Also, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> has the ability to change the factor by, for example, advising the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to choose an extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> a five-year term.

            <content>Non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv), a “non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan” is any <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> arrangement where an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may be paid variable, additional <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> based in whole or in part on the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> paying the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, any <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, or a business unit within the organizational structure of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> or the <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable (i.e., depending on the level within the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>'s or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>'s organization at which the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan is established). A non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan does not include a designated tax-advantaged plan or other forms of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that are not designated tax-advantaged plans, such as those created pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Thus, if contributions to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan or other form of deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined based upon the mortgage-related profits of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> making the contribution, the contribution or benefits are not permitted by § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) (although, in the case of contribution to or benefits under a designated tax-advantaged plan, the benefits or contributions may be permitted by § 1026.36(d)(iii)). Under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> may, for example, be paid directly in cash, stock, or other non-deferred <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>, and the amount to be paid out from the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the distributions to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> may be determined by a fixed formula or may be at the discretion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> (e.g., the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref> may elect not to pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan in a given year), provided the distributions are not directly or indirectly based on the terms of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s transactions. As used in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv) and this commentary, non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plans include, without limitation, bonus pools, profits pools, bonus plans, and profit-sharing plans. <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">Compensation</ref> under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan could include, without limitation, annual or periodic bonuses, or awards of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes or incentives where the bonuses, contributions, or awards are determined with reference to the profitability of the <ref target="1026-2-a-22" reftype="term">person</ref>, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable.

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> that pays its <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> bonuses at the end of a calendar year based on the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s average net return on assets for the calendar year is operating a profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv).

              <content>Time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are determined. Under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv-B-1" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1)</ref>, to determine whether profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> complies with the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit requires a measurement of the ratio of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> during the relevant time period. The time period for which the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is determined is the time period with respect to which the profits from which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is paid are calculated. It does not matter whether the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> are actually paid during that particular time period. For example, assume that for calendar year 2013 a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in the following amounts: $80,000 in commissions based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s performance and volume of loans generated during calendar year; and $10,000 in an employer contribution to a designated tax-advantaged defined contribution plan on behalf of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>. The employer desires to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a year-end profit-related bonus of $10,000. The commissions are paid and employer contributions to the qualified plan are made during calendar year 2013, but the year-end bonus will be paid in January 2014. For purposes of the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit, the year-end bonus is counted as part of both the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for calendar year 2013 even though it is not actually paid until 2014. Therefore, for calendar year 2013 the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that is subject to the 10-percent limit would be $10,000 (i.e., the year-end bonus) and the total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> would be $100,000 (i.e., the sum of the commissions, designated plan contribution, and the projected bonus); the bonus would be permissible under § <ref target="1026-36-d-1-iv" reftype="internal">1026.36(d)(1)(iv)</ref> because it does not exceed 10 percent of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. The determination of total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to 2013 also would not take into account any bonus that is actually paid in 2013 but attributable to a different calendar year (e.g., an annual bonus for 2012 that is paid in January 2013). A company, business unit, or <ref target="1026-32-b-2" reftype="term">affiliate</ref>, as applicable, may pay <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> subject to the 10-percent limit during different time periods falling within its annual accounting period for keeping records and reporting income and expenses, which may be a calendar year or a fiscal year depending on the annual accounting period. In such instances, however, the 10-percent limit applies both as to each time period and cumulatively as to the annual accounting period. For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus at the end of each quarter under a non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan, the payment of each quarterly bonus is subject to the 10-percent limit measured with respect to each quarter. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> can also pay an annual bonus under the non-deferred profits-based <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> plan that does not exceed the difference of 10 percent of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> corresponding to the calendar year and the aggregate amount of quarterly bonuses.</content>

At the end of the year, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> wishes to pay the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> a bonus based on a formula involving a number of performance metrics, to be paid out of a profit pool established at the level of the company but that is derived in part through the company's mortgage originations.

Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> uses a calendar-year accounting period. At the end of the calendar year, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> two bonuses: a “performance” bonus based on the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>'s aggregate loan volume for a calendar year that is paid out of a bonus pool determined with reference to the profitability of the mortgage origination business unit, and a year-end “holiday” bonus in the same amount to all company employees that is paid out of a company-wide bonus pool.

The <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may award the bonus to <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> A under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2). The <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may not award the bonus to <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref> B relying on the exception under § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(2) because it would not apply, although it could award a bonus pursuant to the 10-percent total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> limit in § 1026.36(d)(1)(iv)(B)(1).</content>

If a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> pays <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> to a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> in compliance with § 1026.36(d), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may recover the costs of the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> and other costs of the transaction by charging the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> points or fees or a higher interest rate or a combination of these. Thus, in these transactions, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may charge a higher interest rate to a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who will pay fewer of the costs of the transaction at or before closing or it may offer the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> a lower rate if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pays more of the transaction costs at or before closing. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref><ref target="1026-36-d-1" reftype="internal"> pays half of</ref> the transaction costs at or before closing, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may charge an interest rate of 6.0 percent but, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pays none of the transaction costs at or before closing, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may charge an interest rate of 6.5 percent. In these transactions, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> also may offer different <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> varying interest rates that include a consistent interest rate premium to recoup the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> through increased interest paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> (such as by consistently adding 0.25 percentage points to the interest rate on each transaction where the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is compensated based on a percentage of the amount of the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> extended).</content>

          <content>Effect of modification of transaction terms. U<ref target="1026-36-d-1" reftype="internal">nder § 1026.3</ref>6(d)(1), a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> may not be based on any of the terms of a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction. Thus, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> and a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> may not agree to set the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> at a certain level and then subsequently lower it in selective cases (such as where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is able to obtain a lower rate from another <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>). When the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers to extend <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> with specified terms and conditions (such as the rate and points), the amount of the originator's <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for that transaction is not subject to change (increase or decrease) based on whether different <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms are negotiated. For example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> agrees to lower the rate that was initially offered, the new offer may not be accompanied by a reduction in the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Thus, while the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may change <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> terms or pricing to match a competitor, to avoid triggering high-cost mortgage provisions, or for other reasons, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> on that transaction may not be changed for those reasons. A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-i" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> therefore may not agree to reduce its <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> or provide a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to pay a portion of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s closing costs, for example, to avoid high-cost mortgage provisions. A <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> may not reduce its own <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in a transaction where the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-iii" reftype="term">loan originator organization</ref> receives <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> directly from the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>, with or without a corresponding reduction in <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> paid to an <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originator</ref>.

No violation occurs even if the loans made by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> after July 1 generally carry a higher interest rate than loans made before that date, to reflect the higher <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>.</content>
