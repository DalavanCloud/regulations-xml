          <content>Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a different amount due to rounding.</content>

Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment.

A payment-option ARM, which is an ARM permitting <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> to choose among several different payment options for each billing period, is an example of a loan that may require modification of the § <ref target="1026-20-c" reftype="internal">1026.20(c)</ref> model and sample forms.

              <content>Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a different amount due to rounding.</content>

If a mortgage loan has a &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term"&gt;billing cycle&lt;/ref&gt; shorter than a period of 31 days (for example, a bi-weekly &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-4" reftype="term"&gt;billing cycle&lt;/ref&gt;), a periodic statement covering an entire month may be used. For the purposes of this section, servicer includes the &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term"&gt;creditor&lt;/ref&gt;, assignee, or servicer, as applicable. A &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term"&gt;creditor&lt;/ref&gt; or assignee that does not currently own the mortgage loan or the mortgage servicing rights is not subject to the requirement in this section to provide a periodic statement.</content>

Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a different amount due to rounding.</content>

          <content>Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a different amount due to rounding.</content>

            <content>Definition. A refinancing is a new transaction requiring a complete new set of disclosures. Whether a refinancing has occurred is determined by reference to whether the original obligation has been satisfied or extinguished and replaced by a new obligation, based on the parties' contract and applicable law. The refinancing may involve the consolidation of several existing obligations, disbursement of new money to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or on the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s behalf, or the rescheduling of payments under an existing obligation. In any form, the new obligation must completely replace the prior one.</content>

              <content>The assumption of a nonexempt <ref target="1026-2-a-12" reftype="term">consumer credit</ref> obligation requires no disclosures unless all three elements are present. For example, an automobile dealer need not provide Truth in Lending disclosures to a customer who assumes an existing obligation secured by an automobile.

Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term.

            <content>Amortization payment. Disclosure of the payment needed to amortize fully the outstanding balance at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term is required only when negative amortization occurs as a result of the interest rate adjustment. The disclosure is not required simply because a loan has interest-only or partially-amortizing payments. For example, an ARM with a five-year term and payments based on a longer amortization schedule, in which the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, does not require disclosure of the payment necessary to amortize fully the loan in the remainder of the five-year term. A disclosure is also not required when the new payment is sufficient to prevent negative amortization but the final loan payment will be a different amount due to rounding.</content>

              <content>• [For example, on a $10,000, 30-year loan with an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent in effect in July 1996, the maximum amount that the interest rate can rise under this program is 5 percentage points, to 17.41 percent, and the monthly payment can rise from a first-year payment of $106.03 to a maximum of $145.34 in the fourth year. To see what your payment is, divide your mortgage amount by $10,000; then multiply the monthly payment by that amount. (For example, the monthly payment for a mortgage amount of $60,000 would be: $60,000 ÷ $10,000 = 6; 6 × 106.03 = $636.18 per month.)</content>

Note:
To see what your payments would have been during that period, divide your mortgage amount by $10,000; then multiply the monthly payment by that amount. (For example, in 1996 the monthly payment for a mortgage amount of $60,000 taken out in 1982 would be: $60,000÷$10,000=6; 6×$106.73=$640.38.)
