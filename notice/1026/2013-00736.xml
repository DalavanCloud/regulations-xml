The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent. The loan consummates on March 15, 2014 and the first regular periodic payment is due May 1, 2014. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the first rate adjustment to no more than 8 percent (6 percent plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap) is on April 1, 2019 (the due date of the 60th monthly payment), which occurs less than five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. Thus, the maximum interest rate under the terms of the loan during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 8 percent.</content>

One month after the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization.

Section <ref target="1026-43-d-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(4)</ref> does not require a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> making a refinancing pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref> to comply with the underwriting requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>.

Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> receiving the refinancing has a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> score below this threshold, and therefore would not normally qualify for the rate discount available to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with high <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> scores. This <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-d-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(4)</ref> by offering the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> the discounted rate in connection with the refinancing made pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref>, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> would not normally qualify for that discounted rate, provided that the offer of the discounted rate is not prohibited by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or Federal law.

For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> of $200,000, even though the loan agreement provides that only $100,000 will be disbursed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

Assume also that the maximum premium allowable under the National Housing <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">Act</ref> is $2,000. In this case, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could exclude $2,000 from points and fees but would have to include the $1,000 that exceeds the allowable premium under the National Housing <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">Act</ref>. However, if the $3,000 private mortgage insurance premium were not required to be refunded on a pro rata basis or if the refund were not automatically issued upon notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan, the entire $3,000 premium would be included in points and fees.</content>

If the terms of the legal obligation contain a periodic interest rate adjustment cap that would prevent the initial rate, at the time of the first adjustment, from changing to the rate determined using the index or formula value at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> (i.e., the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref>), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must not give any effect to that rate cap when determining the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref>.

Section <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> generally does not require <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to obtain additional reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> to verify information contained in a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">states</ref> the existence and amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s debt obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not required to obtain additional verification of the existence or amount of that obligation.

For example, certain monthly debt obligations, such as legal obligations like alimony or child support, may not be reflected on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report.

Records are also reasonably reliable if the information in the record was obtained from a valid and legally executed contract. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-2-v" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)(v)</ref> by relying on the amount of monthly ground rent referenced in the ground rent agreement currently in effect and applicable to the subject property.

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first.

One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent.

                <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap).

Pursuant to § <ref target="1026-35-b-2-iv" reftype="internal">1026.35(b)(2)(iv)</ref>, a county is considered to be rural if it is neither in a metropolitan statistical area, nor a micropolitan statistical area adjacent to a metropolitan statistical area, as those terms are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. A county is considered to be underserved if no more than two <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> extend <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> secured by a first lien five or more times in that county during a calendar year.

Thus, for example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> originated 90 first-lien <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transactions</ref> during 2013, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> meets this element of the exception in 2014 if at least 46 of those transactions are secured by first liens on properties located in one or more counties that are on the <ref target="1026-2-a-5" reftype="term">Bureau</ref>'s lists for 2013.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-43-d-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, a “standard mortgage” must provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to defer repayment of principal (see comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-2" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-2</ref>), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term “substantially equal,” see comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-i-Interp-4" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(i)-4</ref>. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a “standard mortgage” because it does not require “regular periodic payments.” See also comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-1" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-1</ref>.</content>

For example, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage that applies the same fixed interest rate to determine the first 60 payments of principal and interest due.

To satisfy § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref>, a loan need not be actually purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Rural Housing Service. Rather, § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref> requires only that the loan be eligible (i.e., meet the criteria) for such purchase, guarantee, or insurance.

        <content>Construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>, a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>. A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. For such a loan, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as separate transactions for the purpose of compliance with § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, and the construction phase of the loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, provided the initial term is 12 months or less. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, allowing similar treatment for disclosures. Where the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term of that construction phase does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial term is 12 months. Any renewal of one year or less also qualifies for the exemption. The permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is not exempt under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>. It may be a qualified mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</content>

        <content>Renewable temporary or “bridge” loan. Under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(ii)</ref>, a temporary or “bridge” loan with a term of 12 months or less is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>. Examples of such a loan are a loan to finance the purchase of a new <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> plans to sell a current <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> within 12 months and a loan to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. Where a temporary or “bridge loan” is renewable, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision provided that any renewal possible under the loan contract is for one year or less. For example, if a construction loan has an initial <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, the loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> is 12 months.</content>

Examples of such a loan are a loan to finance the purchase of a new <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> plans to sell a current <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> within 12 months and a loan to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>.

          <content>Construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>, a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>. A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. For such a loan, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as separate transactions for the purpose of compliance with § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, and the construction phase of the loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, provided the initial term is 12 months or less. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, allowing similar treatment for disclosures. Where the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term of that construction phase does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial term is 12 months. Any renewal of one year or less also qualifies for the exemption. The permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is not exempt under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>. It may be a qualified mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</content>

                <content>General. In general, a charge or fee is “known at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>” if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee will be imposed in connection with the transaction, even if the charge or fee is scheduled to be paid after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. Thus, for example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> charges the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> $400 for an appraisal conducted by an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the $400 is included in points and fees, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> finances it and repays it over the loan term, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee is imposed in connection with the transaction. By contrast, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> does not know whether a charge or fee will be imposed, it is not included in points and fees. For example, charges or fees that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may impose if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> seeks to modify a loan after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> are not included in points and fees, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> does not know at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will seek to modify the loan and therefore incur the fees or charges.</content>

To illustrate: A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> meets the definition of “finance charge” under § 1026.4(a) as “any charge payable directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and imposed directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> as an incident to or a condition of the extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>.” However, § 1026.4(c)(7) specifies that appraisal fees are not included in the finance charge. A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> therefore would not be included in the finance charge and would not be counted in points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1)(i). Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), however, expressly includes in points and fees items listed in § 1026.4(c)(7) (including appraisal fees) if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in connection with the charge. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would receive <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for an appraisal performed by its own employee.

                <content>Definition of bona fide discount point. Section <ref target="1026-32-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(3)</ref> provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. To satisfy this standard, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market transactions. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on pricing in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary market. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also establish that its interest rate reduction is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide imposes a cap on points and fees but excludes from the cap discount points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a discount point and the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-E" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)</ref> or <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-F" reftype="internal">(F)</ref> are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the calculation of points and fees.</content>

                <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

        <content>Discounted and premium adjustable-rate transactions. In some adjustable-rate transactions, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. In some cases, the initial rate charged to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula that will apply after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, as determined at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> (i.e., a “discounted rate”). In other cases, the initial rate may be higher (i.e., a “premium rate”). For purposes of determining the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> where the initial interest rate is not determined using the index or formula for subsequent interest rate adjustments, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the interest rate that would have applied had the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> used such index or formula plus margin at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. That is, in determining the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must not take into account any discounted or premium rate. To illustrate, assume an adjustable-rate transaction where the initial interest rate is not based on an index or formula, or is based on an index or formula that will not apply after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, and is set at 5 percent for the first five years. The loan agreement provides that future interest rate adjustments will be calculated based on a specific index plus a 3 percent margin. If the value of the index at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 5 percent, the interest rate that would have been applied at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> had the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> based the initial rate on this index is 8 percent (5 percent plus 3 percent margin).

For example, assume a loan in an amount of $200,000 that has a five-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, but is amortized over 30 years. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The loan consummates on March 3, 2014, and the monthly payment of principal and interest scheduled for the first five years is $1,199, with the first monthly payment due on April 1, 2014. The balloon payment of $187,308 is required on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, which is April 1, 2019. The loan can be a qualified mortgage if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> underwrites the loan using the scheduled principal and interest payment of $1,199, plus the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment for all <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>, and satisfies the other criteria set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)</ref>.</content>

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance increases to the negative amortization cap of 115 percent of the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref>, or for the first five years of monthly payments (60 payments), whichever occurs first. The loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts monthly according to a specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent.

The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, $798 in the third year, $857 in the fourth year, and $922 in the fifth year.</content>

To rebut the presumption, it must be proven that, despite meeting the standards for a qualified mortgage (including either the debt-to-income standard in § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)</ref> or the standards of one of the entities specified in § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref>), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. Specifically, it must be proven that, at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, based on the information available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s income, debt obligations, alimony, child support, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment (including <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>) on the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> and on any <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loans</ref> of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> would leave the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with insufficient residual income or assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> (including any real property attached to the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>) that secures the loan with which to meet living expenses, including any recurring and material non-debt obligations of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> thereby did not make a reasonable and good faith determination of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may rebut the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s residual income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical expenses of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and after taking into account the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> securing the loan, such as a savings account. In addition, the longer the period of time that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or, for an adjustable-rate mortgage, after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, the less likely the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</content>

          <content>A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years, after which the interest rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 9 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent. The loan is consummated on March 15, 2014, and the first regular periodic payment is due May 1, 2014. The loan agreement provides that the first rate adjustment occurs on April 1, 2017 (the due date of the 36th monthly payment); the second rate adjustment occurs on April 1, 2018 (the due date of the 48th monthly payment); and the third rate adjustment occurs on April 1, 2019 (the due date of the 60th monthly payment). Under this example, the maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment due is 9 percent (the lifetime interest rate cap), which applies beginning on April 1, 2018 (the due date of the 48th monthly payment). The outstanding principal balance at the end of the fourth year (after the 48th payment is credited) is $188,218.</content>

            <content>Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years and interest-only payments for five years. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, but provides for interest-only payments for the first five years. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years, after which the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 7.5 percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent). The monthly payments for the first three years are $833. For the fourth year, the payments are $1,167, based on an interest rate of 7 percent, calculated by adding the 2 percent annual adjustment cap to the initial rate of 5 percent. For the fifth year, the payments are $1,250, applying the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> of 7.5 percent.

            <content>First, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must determine the “tier” into which the loan falls based on the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref>. The <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> is the principal amount the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will borrow, as reflected in the promissory note or loan contract. See § <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(5)</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> is $55,000, the loan falls into the tier for loans greater than or equal to $20,000 but less than $60,000, to which a 5 percent cap on <ref target="1026-43-b-9" reftype="term">points and fees</ref> applies. For tiers with a prescribed dollar limit on <ref target="1026-43-b-9" reftype="term">points and fees</ref> (e.g., for loans from $60,000 up to $100,000, the limit is $3,000), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> does not need to do any further calculations.</content>

        <content>Regular periodic payments. Under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(i)</ref>, a qualified mortgage must provide for regular periodic payments that may not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest, on a monthly or other periodic basis, that will fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The periodic payments must be substantially equal except for the effect that any interest rate change after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> has on the payment in the case of an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. In addition, because § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(i)</ref> requires that a qualified mortgage provide for regular periodic payments, a single-payment transaction may not be a qualified mortgage.</content>

Section <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary describe certain requirements for making this ability-to-repay determination, but do not provide comprehensive underwriting standards to which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must adhere.

            <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

        <content>A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 6 percent that is fixed for an initial period of five years, after which the interest rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent. The loan consummates on March 15, 2014 and the first regular periodic payment is due May 1, 2014. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the first rate adjustment to no more than 8 percent (6 percent plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap) is on April 1, 2019 (the due date of the 60th monthly payment), which occurs less than five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. Thus, the maximum interest rate under the terms of the loan during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 8 percent.</content>

For example, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage that applies the same fixed interest rate to determine the first 60 payments of principal and interest due.

              <content>Records sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. Records are sufficient to evidence payment and receipt of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> if they demonstrate the following facts: The nature and amount of the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>; that the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> was paid, and by whom; that the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> was received, and by whom; and when the payment and receipt of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> occurred. The <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> agreements themselves are to be retained in all circumstances consistent with § <ref target="1026-25-c-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.25(c)(2)(i)</ref>. The additional records that are sufficient necessarily will vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts and circumstances, particularly with regard to the nature of the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref>. For example, if the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the form of a salary, records to be retained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code that demonstrate the amount of the salary. If the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the form of a contribution to or a benefit under a designated tax-advantaged retirement plan, records to be maintained might include copies of required filings under the Internal Revenue Code or applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">Act</ref> of 1974 (ERISA), <ref target="USC:29-1001" reftype="external">29 U.S.C. 1001</ref> et seq., relating to the plans, copies of the plan and amendments thereto in which <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">individual loan originators</ref> participate and the names of any <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originators</ref> covered by such plans, or determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service regarding such plans. If the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> is in the nature of a commission or bonus, records to be retained might include a settlement agent “flow of funds” worksheet or other written record or a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> closing instructions letter directing disbursement of fees at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. Where a <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is a mortgage broker, a disclosure of <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> or broker agreement required by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> law that recites the broker's total <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for a transaction is a record of the amount actually paid to the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> in connection with the transaction, unless actual <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> deviates from the amount in the disclosure or agreement. Where <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> has been decreased to defray the cost, in whole or part, of an unforeseen increase in an actual settlement cost over an estimated settlement cost disclosed to the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> pursuant to section 5(c) of RESPA (or omitted from that disclosure), records to be maintained are those documenting the decrease in <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> and reasons for it.</content>

For example, they may provide, by the terms of the agreement, that the agreement governs <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> payable on transactions consummated on or after some future effective date (in which case, a prior agreement governs transactions consummated in the meantime). For purposes of applying the record retention requirement to transaction-specific commissions, the relevant <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> agreement for a given transaction is the agreement pursuant to which <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for that transaction is determined.</content>

For example, where a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is a home purchase loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s periodic payment obligation for any “piggyback” second-lien loan that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be used to finance part of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s down payment. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with this requirement where, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> follows policies and procedures that are designed to determine whether at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has applied for another <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. To illustrate, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives an application for a home purchase loan where the requested <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> is less than the home purchase price. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s policies and procedures must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> the source of the down payment and provide verification. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> determines the source of the down payment is another extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> that will be made to the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> and secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know of the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> and must consider the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref>. Alternatively, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has information that suggests the down payment source is the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s existing assets, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would be under no further obligation to determine whether a <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> will be extended at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>.

            <content>General.

To rebut the presumption, it must be proven that, despite meeting the standards for a qualified mortgage (including either the debt-to-income standard in § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)</ref> or the standards of one of the entities specified in § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref>), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. Specifically, it must be proven that, at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, based on the information available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s income, debt obligations, alimony, child support, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment (including <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>) on the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> and on any <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loans</ref> of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> would leave the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with insufficient residual income or assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> (including any real property attached to the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>) that secures the loan with which to meet living expenses, including any recurring and material non-debt obligations of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> thereby did not make a reasonable and good faith determination of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may rebut the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s residual income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical expenses of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and after taking into account the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> securing the loan, such as a savings account. In addition, the longer the period of time that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or, for an adjustable-rate mortgage, after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, the less likely the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</content>

        <content>Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years and interest-only payments for five years. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, but provides for interest-only payments for the first five years. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years, after which the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 7.5 percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent). The monthly payments for the first three years are $833. For the fourth year, the payments are $1,167, based on an interest rate of 7 percent, calculated by adding the 2 percent annual adjustment cap to the initial rate of 5 percent. For the fifth year, the payments are $1,250, applying the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> of 7.5 percent. These first five years of payments will cover only the interest due. The loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, after which the scheduled monthly payments increase to $1,478, a monthly payment that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> of $200,000 over the remaining 25 years of the loan (300 months). For purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-c-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)(iii)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay the loan based on a monthly payment of $1,478, which is the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest that would repay $200,000 over the 25 years remaining as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> using the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> of 7.5 percent.</content>

A “standard mortgage” must have an interest rate that is fixed for at least the first five years (60 months) after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

The date that is five years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is August 15, 2018. The first interest rate adjustment occurs on September 1, 2018.

The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-2-v" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)(v)</ref> by dividing the $1,200 special assessment by 12 months and including the resulting $100 monthly amount in the determination of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment for <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies by using this calculation even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> intends to pay the special assessment in a manner other than that used by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> in determining the monthly pro rata amount, such as where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> intends to pay six $200 installments.</content>

Notes:
i. This policy assures that a &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term"&gt;consumer&lt;/ref&gt; either has sufficient income to make both mortgage payments without any rentalincome, or has an equity position not likely to result in defaulting on the mortgage on the property being vacated.
ii. This applies solely to a principal residence being vacated in favor of another principal residence. It does not apply to existing rental properties disclosed on the loan application and confirmed by tax returns (Schedule E of form IRS 1040).

            <content>Regular periodic payments. Under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(i)</ref>, a qualified mortgage must provide for regular periodic payments that may not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest, on a monthly or other periodic basis, that will fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The periodic payments must be substantially equal except for the effect that any interest rate change after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> has on the payment in the case of an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. In addition, because § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(i)</ref> requires that a qualified mortgage provide for regular periodic payments, a single-payment transaction may not be a qualified mortgage.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-B" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(i)(B)</ref>, a qualified mortgage's regular periodic payments may not allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to defer repayment of principal, except as provided in § <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)</ref>. A loan allows the deferral of principal repayment if one or more of the periodic payments may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal. Deferred principal repayment also occurs if the payment is applied to both accrued interest and principal but the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is permitted to make periodic payments that are less than the amount that would be required under a payment schedule that has substantially equal payments that fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

The loan agreement provides for an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent, and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 12 percent. The first rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 36th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 7 percent (5 percent initial discounted rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The second rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 48th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 9 percent (7 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap).

            <content>Example. Assume that a $3,000 private mortgage insurance premium charged on a closed-end mortgage loan is payable at or before closing and is required to be refunded on a pro rata basis and that the refund is automatically issued upon notification of the satisfaction of the underlying mortgage loan. Assume also that the maximum premium allowable under the National Housing <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">Act</ref> is $2,000. In this case, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could exclude $2,000 from points and fees but would have to include the $1,000 that exceeds the allowable premium under the National Housing <ref target="1026-2-a-1" reftype="term">Act</ref>.

          <content>Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years and interest-only payments for five years. A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, but provides for interest-only payments for the first five years. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years, after which the interest rate will adjust each year based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 7.5 percent (4.5 percent plus 3 percent). The monthly payments for the first three years are $833. For the fourth year, the payments are $1,167, based on an interest rate of 7 percent, calculated by adding the 2 percent annual adjustment cap to the initial rate of 5 percent. For the fifth year, the payments are $1,250, applying the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> of 7.5 percent.

          <content>Payment due date. Whether a payment is more than 30 days late is measured in relation to the contractual due date not accounting for any grace period. For example, if the contractual due date for a non-standard mortgage payment is the first day of every month, but no late fee will be charged as long as the payment is received by the 16th of the month, the payment due date for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-d-2-iv" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(2)(iv)</ref> and (v) is the first day of the month, not the 16th day of the month.

ii. This applies solely to a principal residence being vacated in favor of another principal residence. It does not apply to existing rental properties disclosed on the loan application and confirmed by tax returns (Schedule E of form IRS 1040).

A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>.

Where the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term of that construction phase does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial term is 12 months.

The permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is not exempt under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>. It may be a qualified mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</content>

However, § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the provisions of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting criteria. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to guidance issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property as “income,” “debt,” or “assets.” Similarly, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or what information to use when evaluating the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “<ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>. These examples are illustrative, and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such entities. However, as required by § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>, result in a reasonable, good faith determination of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards or when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself unreasonable.</content>

              <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

          <content>Regular periodic payments. Under § <ref target="1026-43-d-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, a “standard mortgage” must provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to defer repayment of principal (see comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-2" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-2</ref>), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term “substantially equal,” see comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-i-Interp-4" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(i)-4</ref>. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a “standard mortgage” because it does not require “regular periodic payments.” See also comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-1" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-1</ref>.</content>

        <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

          <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

        <content>A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance increases to the negative amortization cap of 115 percent of the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref>, or for the first five years of monthly payments (60 payments), whichever occurs first. The loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts monthly according to a specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, $798 in the third year, $857 in the fourth year, and $922 in the fifth year.</content>

        <content>Renewable balloon-payment mortgage; <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. A balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> could provide that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment mortgage at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s control). See comment <ref target="1026-17-c-1-Interp-11" reftype="internal">17(c)(1)-11</ref> discussing renewable balloon-payment mortgages. For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any period of time that could result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option. In this example, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> for the balloon-payment mortgage is three years, and not the potential six years that could result if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> chooses to renew the loan. Accordingly, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using the maximum payment scheduled in the first five years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, which includes the balloon payment due at the end of the three-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. See comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii-A-Interp-4-ii" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(ii)(A)-4.ii</ref>, which provides an example of how to determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a three-year renewable balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref>.</content>

Balloon payments often result when the periodic payment would fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> only if made over some period that is longer than the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. For example, a <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> of 10 years with periodic payments based on an amortization period of 20 years would result in a balloon payment being due at the end of the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. Whatever the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, the amortization period used to determine the scheduled periodic payments that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must pay under the terms of the legal obligation may not exceed 30 years.</content>

Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest, on a monthly or other periodic basis, that will fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

        <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage with negative amortization. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years. The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum periodic payments for as long as possible, the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> is $207,662, which is reached at the end of the third year of the loan (on the due date of the 36th monthly payment). See comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii-C-Interp-3" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(ii)(C)-3</ref> providing examples of how to determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a negative amortization loan.</content>

          <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

Under this example, the maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment due is 9 percent (the lifetime interest rate cap), which applies beginning on April 1, 2018 (the due date of the 48th monthly payment). The outstanding principal balance at the end of the fourth year (after the 48th payment is credited) is $188,218.</content>

Under § <ref target="1026-43-d-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, a “standard mortgage” must provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to defer repayment of principal (see comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-2" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-2</ref>), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment.

The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years.

Section <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary describe certain requirements for making this ability-to-repay determination, but do not provide comprehensive underwriting standards to which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must adhere. For example, the rule and commentary do not specify how much income is needed to support a particular level of debt or how <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history should be weighed against other factors. So long as <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> consider the factors set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> according to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are permitted to develop their own underwriting standards and make changes to those standards over time in response to empirical information and changing economic and other conditions. Whether a particular ability-to-repay determination is reasonable and in good faith will depend not only on the underwriting standards adopted by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, but on the facts and circumstances of an individual extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> and how a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards were applied to those facts and circumstances. A <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s statement or attestation that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has the ability to repay the loan is not indicative of whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination was reasonable and in good faith.</content>

A <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report generally is considered a reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> under § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> for purposes of verifying items customarily found on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, such as the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s current debt obligations, monthly debts, and <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history. Section <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> generally does not require <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> to obtain additional reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> to verify information contained in a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">states</ref> the existence and amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s debt obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not required to obtain additional verification of the existence or amount of that obligation. In contrast, a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report does not serve as a reasonably reliably <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> for purposes of verifying items that do not appear on the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. For example, certain monthly debt obligations, such as legal obligations like alimony or child support, may not be reflected on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. Thus, a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report that does not list a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly alimony obligation does not serve as a reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party record</ref> for purposes of verifying that obligation. If a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report reflects a current debt obligation that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has not listed on the application, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> considers the existence and amount of the debt obligation as it is reflected in the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report. However, in some cases a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may know or have reason to know that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report may be inaccurate in whole or in part. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may have information indicating that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is subject to a fraud alert, extended alert, active duty alert, or similar alert identified in <ref target="USC:15-1681" reftype="external">15 U.S.C. 1681</ref>c-1 or that a debt obligation listed on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is subject to a statement of dispute pursuant to <ref target="USC:15-1681" reftype="external">15 U.S.C. 1681</ref>i(b). A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also have other reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> or other information or evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> reasonably finds to be reliable that contradict the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report or otherwise indicate that the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report is inaccurate. If a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know that a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report may be inaccurate in whole or in part, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-c-3" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(3)</ref> by disregarding an inaccurate or disputed item, items, or <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, but does not have to obtain additional <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also, but is not required, to obtain other reasonably reliable <ref target="1026-43-b-13" reftype="term">third-party records</ref> to verify information with respect to which the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report, or item therein, may be inaccurate. For example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> might obtain statements or bank records regarding a particular debt obligation subject to a statement of dispute.

          <content>General. Section <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> sets forth factors <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must consider when making the ability-to-repay determination required under § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref> and the accompanying commentary provides guidance regarding these factors. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> must conform to these requirements and may rely on guidance provided in the commentary. However, § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the provisions of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting criteria. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to guidance issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property as “income,” “debt,” or “assets.” Similarly, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or what information to use when evaluating the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “<ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>. These examples are illustrative, and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such entities. However, as required by § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>, result in a reasonable, good faith determination of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards or when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself unreasonable.</content>

For example, where a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is a home purchase loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s periodic payment obligation for any “piggyback” second-lien loan that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be used to finance part of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s down payment. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with this requirement where, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> follows policies and procedures that are designed to determine whether at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has applied for another <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>.

Some aspects of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history, whether positive or negative, may not be directly indicative of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> therefore may give various aspects of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history as much or as little weight as is appropriate to reach a reasonable, good faith determination of ability to repay. Where a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “<ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>,” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to nontraditional <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> references, such as rental payment history or utility payments.</content>

          <content>Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

          <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the initial interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment) and accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments as scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year. As a result, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s minimum monthly payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization (i.e., the accrued but unpaid interest is added to the principal balance).

In determining a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> under § <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s payment obligation on any <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be or has been made at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>. For example, where a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is a home purchase loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s periodic payment obligation for any “piggyback” second-lien loan that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know will be used to finance part of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s down payment. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with this requirement where, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> follows policies and procedures that are designed to determine whether at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has applied for another <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> transaction secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>. To illustrate, assume a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives an application for a home purchase loan where the requested <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> is less than the home purchase price. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s policies and procedures must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">state</ref> the source of the down payment and provide verification. If the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> determines the source of the down payment is another extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> that will be made to the same <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> and secured by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows or has reason to know of the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> and must consider the <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref>. Alternatively, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has information that suggests the down payment source is the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s existing assets, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would be under no further obligation to determine whether a <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> will be extended at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not obligated to investigate beyond reasonable underwriting policies and procedures to determine whether a <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loan</ref> will be extended at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref>.</content>

        <content>Example. Under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)(ii)</ref>, if a qualified mortgage provides for a balloon payment, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must determine that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> is able to make all scheduled payments under the legal obligation other than the balloon payment. For example, assume a loan in an amount of $200,000 that has a five-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>, but is amortized over 30 years. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The loan consummates on March 3, 2014, and the monthly payment of principal and interest scheduled for the first five years is $1,199, with the first monthly payment due on April 1, 2014. The balloon payment of $187,308 is required on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, which is April 1, 2019. The loan can be a qualified mortgage if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> underwrites the loan using the scheduled principal and interest payment of $1,199, plus the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment for all <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>, and satisfies the other criteria set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)</ref>.</content>

        <content>First five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. Under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-iv-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(iv)(A)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using the maximum interest rate that may apply during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. To illustrate, assume an adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed interest rate of 5 percent for the first five years, measured from the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, after which the interest rate will adjust annually to the specified index plus a margin of 6 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 5.5 percent. The loan consummates on September 15, 2014, and the first monthly payment is due on November 1, 2014. The first rate adjustment to no more than 7 percent (5 percent plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap) occurs on the due date of the 60th monthly payment, which is October 1, 2019, and therefore, the rate adjustment occurs during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. To meet the definition of qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-e-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using a monthly payment of principal and interest based on an interest rate of 7 percent.</content>

The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

            <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage with negative amortization. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years. The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum periodic payments for as long as possible, the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> is $207,662, which is reached at the end of the third year of the loan (on the due date of the 36th monthly payment).

Examples of such a loan are a loan to finance the purchase of a new <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> where the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> plans to sell a current <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> within 12 months and a loan to finance the initial construction of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>.

              <content>Construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>, a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>. A construction-to-permanent loan is a potentially multiple-advance loan to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or improvement of a <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> that may be permanently financed by the same <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>. For such a loan, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as separate transactions for the purpose of compliance with § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, and the construction phase of the loan is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref>, provided the initial term is 12 months or less. See § <ref target="1026-17-c-6-ii" reftype="internal">1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</ref>, allowing similar treatment for disclosures. Where the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan is renewable for a period of one year or less, the term of that construction phase does not include any additional period of time that could result from a renewal provision. For example, if the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan has an initial term of 12 months but is renewable for another 12-month term before permanent financing begins, the construction phase is exempt from § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> through <ref target="1026-43-f" reftype="internal">(f)</ref> because the initial term is 12 months. Any renewal of one year or less also qualifies for the exemption. The permanent phase of the loan is treated as a separate transaction and is not exempt under § <ref target="1026-43-a-3-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(a)(3)(iii)</ref>. It may be a qualified mortgage if it satisfies the appropriate requirements.</content>

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

Section <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary describe certain requirements for making this ability-to-repay determination, but do not provide comprehensive underwriting standards to which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must adhere. For example, the rule and commentary do not specify how much income is needed to support a particular level of debt or how <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history should be weighed against other factors. So long as <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> consider the factors set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> according to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are permitted to develop their own underwriting standards and make changes to those standards over time in response to empirical information and changing economic and other conditions.

                  <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

              <content>General. Section <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> sets forth factors <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must consider when making the ability-to-repay determination required under § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref> and the accompanying commentary provides guidance regarding these factors. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> must conform to these requirements and may rely on guidance provided in the commentary. However, § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the provisions of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting criteria. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to guidance issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property as “income,” “debt,” or “assets.” Similarly, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or what information to use when evaluating the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “<ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>. These examples are illustrative, and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such entities. However, as required by § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>, result in a reasonable, good faith determination of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards or when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself unreasonable.</content>

A balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> could provide that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment mortgage at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s control). See comment <ref target="1026-17-c-1-Interp-11" reftype="internal">17(c)(1)-11</ref> discussing renewable balloon-payment mortgages. For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any period of time that could result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option.

                  <content>General.

                      <content>Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 8 percent (4.5 percent plus 3.5 percent). The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

                      <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum possible time.

                    <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to the 12.5 percent payment cap, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will begin making payments that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third year.

Section <ref target="1026-43-d-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(4)</ref> does not require a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> making a refinancing pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref> to comply with the underwriting requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>.

For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is providing a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with a refinancing made pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref> and that this <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has a documented practice of offering rate discounts to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> scores above a certain threshold. Assume further that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> receiving the refinancing has a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> score below this threshold, and therefore would not normally qualify for the rate discount available to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with high <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> scores. This <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with § <ref target="1026-43-d-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(4)</ref> by offering the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> the discounted rate in connection with the refinancing made pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref>, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> would not normally qualify for that discounted rate, provided that the offer of the discounted rate is not prohibited by applicable <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">State</ref> or Federal law. However, § <ref target="1026-43-d-4" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(4)</ref> does not require a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> to offer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> such a discounted rate.</content>

For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may rebut the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s residual income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical expenses of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and after taking into account the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> securing the loan, such as a savings account. In addition, the longer the period of time that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or, for an adjustable-rate mortgage, after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, the less likely the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</content>

Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest, on a monthly or other periodic basis, that will fully repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

For example, a balloon-payment qualified mortgage under § <ref target="1026-43-f-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(f)(1)</ref> that is sold pursuant to a capital restoration plan under <ref target="USC:12-1831" reftype="external">12 U.S.C. 1831</ref>o would retain its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale. However, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> simply chose to sell the same qualified mortgage as one way to comply with general regulatory capital requirements in the absence of supervisory action or agreement it would lose its status as a qualified mortgage following the sale unless it qualifies under another definition of qualified mortgage.</content>

        <content>Payment calculation for a standard mortgage. In determining whether the monthly periodic payment for a standard mortgage is materially lower than the monthly periodic payment for a non-standard mortgage, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the monthly payment for the standard mortgage that will result in substantially equal, monthly, <ref target="1026-43-b-2" reftype="term">fully amortizing payments</ref> (as defined in § <ref target="1026-43-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(2)</ref>) using the rate as of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

        <content>Interest rate adjustment caps. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> should assume the interest rate increases after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> as rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation. That is, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> should account for any periodic interest rate adjustment cap that may limit how quickly the interest rate can increase under the terms of the legal obligation. Where a range for the maximum interest rate during the first five years is provided, the highest rate in that range is the maximum interest rate for purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-iv" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(iv)</ref>. Where the terms of the legal obligation are not based on an index plus margin or formula, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the maximum interest rate that occurs during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due.

          <content>Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years. Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage has an initial discounted rate of 5 percent that is fixed for the first three years, measured from the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, after which the rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent. The loan agreement provides for an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent, and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 12 percent. The first rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 36th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 7 percent (5 percent initial discounted rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The second rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 48th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 9 percent (7 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The third rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 60th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 11 percent (9 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate cap adjustment). The maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 11 percent (the rate on the due date of the 60th monthly payment). For further discussion of how to determine whether a rate adjustment occurs during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due, see comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-iv-Interp-7" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(iv)-7</ref>.</content>

          <content>General. In general, a charge or fee is “known at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>” if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee will be imposed in connection with the transaction, even if the charge or fee is scheduled to be paid after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. Thus, for example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> charges the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> $400 for an appraisal conducted by an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the $400 is included in points and fees, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> finances it and repays it over the loan term, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee is imposed in connection with the transaction. By contrast, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> does not know whether a charge or fee will be imposed, it is not included in points and fees. For example, charges or fees that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may impose if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> seeks to modify a loan after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> are not included in points and fees, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> does not know at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> whether the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will seek to modify the loan and therefore incur the fees or charges.</content>

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first.

        <content>General. For purposes of determining the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay a negative amortization loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use substantially equal, monthly payments of principal and interest based on the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> or the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-ii" reftype="term">introductory rate</ref>, whichever is greater, that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> over the term of the loan that remains as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Accordingly, before determining the substantially equal, monthly payments the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must first determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> and the period of time that remains in the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> after the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. “<ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">Recast</ref>” is defined in § <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(11)</ref>.

            <content>Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 8 percent (4.5 percent plus 3.5 percent). The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

            <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum possible time. Because the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s minimum monthly payments are less than the interest accrued each month, negative amortization occurs (i.e., the accrued but unpaid interest is added to the principal balance). Thus, assuming that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments for as long as possible and that the maximum interest rate of 10.5 percent is reached at the first rate adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), the negative amortization cap of 115 percent is reached on the due date of the 27th monthly payment and the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> as of that date. The <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> as of the due date of the 27th monthly payment is $229,251, and the remaining term of the loan is 27 years and nine months (333 months).</content>

          <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to the 12.5 percent payment cap, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will begin making payments that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third year. Thus, the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 36th monthly payment. The <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> on that date is $207,662, and the remaining <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> is 27 years (324 months).

ii. Child support may be “grossed up” under the same provisions as non-taxable income sources.

Notes:
i. This policy assures that a &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term"&gt;consumer&lt;/ref&gt; either has sufficient income to make both mortgage payments without any rentalincome, or has an equity position not likely to result in defaulting on the mortgage on the property being vacated.
ii. This applies solely to a principal residence being vacated in favor of another principal residence. It does not apply to existing rental properties disclosed on the loan application and confirmed by tax returns (Schedule E of form IRS 1040).

To illustrate: A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> meets the definition of “finance charge” under § 1026.4(a) as “any charge payable directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and imposed directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> as an incident to or a condition of the extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>.” However, § 1026.4(c)(7) specifies that appraisal fees are not included in the finance charge. A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> therefore would not be included in the finance charge and would not be counted in points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1)(i). Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), however, expressly includes in points and fees items listed in § 1026.4(c)(7) (including appraisal fees) if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in connection with the charge. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would receive <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for an appraisal performed by its own employee. Thus, the appraisal fee in this example must be included in the calculation of points and fees.</content>

In this case, if, on the date the interest rate for the transaction is set, the loan officer has originated 10 or fewer transactions that year, then none of the year-end bonus is attributable to the transaction and therefore none of the bonus is included in points and fees for that transaction.

        <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

To rebut the presumption, it must be proven that, despite meeting the standards for a qualified mortgage (including either the debt-to-income standard in § <ref target="1026-43-e-2-vi" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(2)(vi)</ref> or the standards of one of the entities specified in § <ref target="1026-43-e-4-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(e)(4)(ii)</ref>), the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. Specifically, it must be proven that, at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, based on the information available to the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s income, debt obligations, alimony, child support, and the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s monthly payment (including <ref target="1026-43-b-8" reftype="term">mortgage-related obligations</ref>) on the <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> and on any <ref target="1026-43-b-12" reftype="term">simultaneous loans</ref> of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> would leave the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with insufficient residual income or assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> (including any real property attached to the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref>) that secures the loan with which to meet living expenses, including any recurring and material non-debt obligations of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> thereby did not make a reasonable and good faith determination of the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> may rebut the presumption with evidence demonstrating that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s residual income was insufficient to meet living expenses, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and health care, including the payment of recurring medical expenses of which the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> was aware at the time of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, and after taking into account the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s assets other than the value of the <ref target="1026-2-a-19" reftype="term">dwelling</ref> securing the loan, such as a savings account. In addition, the longer the period of time that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> has demonstrated actual ability to repay the loan by making timely payments, without modification or accommodation, after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or, for an adjustable-rate mortgage, after <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>, the less likely the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will be able to rebut the presumption based on insufficient residual income and prove that, at the time the loan was made, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> had the reasonable ability to repay the loan.</content>

              <content>A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance increases to the negative amortization cap of 115 percent of the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref>, or for the first five years of monthly payments (60 payments), whichever occurs first. The loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage that adjusts monthly according to a specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, $798 in the third year, $857 in the fourth year, and $922 in the fifth year.</content>

            <content>Payment calculation for a standard mortgage. In determining whether the monthly periodic payment for a standard mortgage is materially lower than the monthly periodic payment for a non-standard mortgage, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must consider the monthly payment for the standard mortgage that will result in substantially equal, monthly, <ref target="1026-43-b-2" reftype="term">fully amortizing payments</ref> (as defined in § <ref target="1026-43-b-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(2)</ref>) using the rate as of <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>.

For example, if the rate for the first two years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 4 percent, the rate for the following two years is 5 percent, and the rate for the next two years is 6 percent, the rate that must be used is 6 percent.</content>

            <content>Definition of bona fide discount point. Section <ref target="1026-32-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(3)</ref> provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. To satisfy this standard, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market transactions. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on pricing in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary market. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also establish that its interest rate reduction is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide imposes a cap on points and fees but excludes from the cap discount points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a discount point and the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-E" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)</ref> or <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-F" reftype="internal">(F)</ref> are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the calculation of points and fees.</content>

The amount of <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that can be attributed to a transaction is determined as of the date the interest rate is set. Thus, <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for a transaction includes the portion of a bonus, commission, or award of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes that can be attributed to that transaction at the time the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> sets the interest rate for the transaction, even if that bonus, commission, or award of merchandise, services, trips, or similar prizes is not paid until after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. For example, assume a $100,000 transaction and that, as of the date the interest rate is set, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> is entitled to receive a commission equal to 1 percent of the loan amount at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, i.e., $1,000, payable at the end of the month. In addition, assume that after the date the interest rate is set but before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the transaction, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> originates other transactions that enable the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> to meet a loan volume threshold, which increases the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref>'s commission to 1.25 percent of the loan amount, i.e., $1,250. In this case, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> need include only $1,000 as <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in points and fees because, as of the date the interest rate was set, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> would have been entitled to receive $1,000 upon <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the transaction.</content>

            <content>General. In general, a charge or fee is “known at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>” if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee will be imposed in connection with the transaction, even if the charge or fee is scheduled to be paid after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>. Thus, for example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> charges the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> $400 for an appraisal conducted by an <ref target="1026-32-b-5" reftype="term">affiliate</ref> of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>, the $400 is included in points and fees, even if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> finances it and repays it over the loan term, because the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> knows at or before <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> that the charge or fee is imposed in connection with the transaction.

To illustrate: A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> meets the definition of “finance charge” under § 1026.4(a) as “any charge payable directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> and imposed directly or indirectly by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> as an incident to or a condition of the extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>.” However, § 1026.4(c)(7) specifies that appraisal fees are not included in the finance charge. A fee imposed by the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> for an appraisal performed by an employee of the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> therefore would not be included in the finance charge and would not be counted in points and fees under § 1026.32(b)(1)(i). Section 1026.32(b)(1)(iii), however, expressly includes in points and fees items listed in § 1026.4(c)(7) (including appraisal fees) if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> receives <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in connection with the charge. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> would receive <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> for an appraisal performed by its own employee. Thus, the appraisal fee in this example must be included in the calculation of points and fees.</content>

In this case, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> need include only $1,000 as <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> in points and fees because, as of the date the interest rate was set, the <ref target="1026-36-a-1-ii" reftype="term">loan originator</ref> would have been entitled to receive $1,000 upon <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> of the transaction.</content>

A balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> could provide that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment mortgage at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s control). See comment <ref target="1026-17-c-1-Interp-11" reftype="internal">17(c)(1)-11</ref> discussing renewable balloon-payment mortgages. For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any period of time that could result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option. In this example, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> for the balloon-payment mortgage is three years, and not the potential six years that could result if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> chooses to renew the loan. Accordingly, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using the maximum payment scheduled in the first five years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, which includes the balloon payment due at the end of the three-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent.

The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

                <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum possible time.

              <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap).

During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization.

Under the terms of the loan agreement, the first rate adjustment is on April 1, 2021 (the due date of the 84th monthly payment), which occurs more than five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due. Thus, the maximum interest rate under the terms of the loan during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 6 percent.</content>

Section <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary describe certain requirements for making this ability-to-repay determination, but do not provide comprehensive underwriting standards to which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must adhere. For example, the rule and commentary do not specify how much income is needed to support a particular level of debt or how <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history should be weighed against other factors. So long as <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> consider the factors set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> according to the requirements of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are permitted to develop their own underwriting standards and make changes to those standards over time in response to empirical information and changing economic and other conditions.

                <content>All of the considerations listed in paragraphs (A) and (B) above may be relevant to whether a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination was reasonable and in good faith. However, these considerations are not requirements or prohibitions with which <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must comply, nor are they elements of a claim that a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> must prove to establish a violation of the ability-to-repay requirements. For example, <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to validate their underwriting criteria using mathematical models. These considerations also are not absolute in their application; instead they exist on a continuum and may apply to varying degrees. For example, the longer a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> successfully makes timely payments after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> or <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> the less likely it is that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s determination of ability to repay was unreasonable or not in good faith. Finally, each of these considerations must be viewed in the context of all facts and circumstances relevant to a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>. For example, in some cases inconsistent application of underwriting standards may indicate that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is manipulating those standards to approve a loan despite a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s inability to repay. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s ability-to-repay determination therefore may be unreasonable or in bad faith. However, in other cases inconsistently applied underwriting standards may be the result of, for example, inadequate training and may nonetheless yield a reasonable and good faith ability-to-repay determination in a particular case. Similarly, although an early payment default on a mortgage will often be persuasive evidence that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> did not have a reasonable and good faith belief in the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay (and such evidence may even be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an ability-to-repay violation), a particular ability-to-repay determination may be reasonable and in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> defaulted shortly after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> experienced a sudden and unexpected loss of income. In contrast, an ability-to-repay determination may be unreasonable or not in good faith even though the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> made timely payments for a significant period of time if, for example, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> was able to make those payments only by foregoing necessities such as food and heat.</content>

            <content>General. Section <ref target="1026-43-c-2" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)</ref> sets forth factors <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> must consider when making the ability-to-repay determination required under § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref> and the accompanying commentary provides guidance regarding these factors. <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">Creditors</ref> must conform to these requirements and may rely on guidance provided in the commentary. However, § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref> and the accompanying commentary do not provide comprehensive guidance on definitions and other technical underwriting criteria necessary for evaluating these factors in practice. So long as a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> complies with the provisions of § <ref target="1026-43-c" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is permitted to use its own definitions and other technical underwriting criteria. A <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may, but is not required to, look to guidance issued by entities such as the Federal Housing Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while operating under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to classify particular inflows, obligations, or property as “income,” “debt,” or “assets.” Similarly, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may refer to such guidance to determine what information to use when evaluating the income of a self-employed or seasonally employed <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> or what information to use when evaluating the <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> history of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> who has obtained few or no extensions of traditional “<ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>” as defined in § <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="internal">1026.2(a)(14)</ref>. These examples are illustrative, and <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditors</ref> are not required to conform to guidance issued by these or other such entities. However, as required by § <ref target="1026-43-c-1" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(1)</ref>, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must ensure that its underwriting criteria, as applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular extension of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref>, result in a reasonable, good faith determination of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay. For example, a definition used in underwriting that is reasonable in isolation may lead to ability-to-repay determinations that are unreasonable or not in good faith when considered in the context of a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref>'s underwriting standards or when adopted or applied in bad faith. Similarly, an ability-to-repay determination is not unreasonable or in bad faith merely because the underwriting criteria used included a definition that was by itself unreasonable.</content>

For example, if a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report <ref target="1026-2-a-26" reftype="term">states</ref> the existence and amount of a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s debt obligation, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is not required to obtain additional verification of the existence or amount of that obligation.

For example, certain monthly debt obligations, such as legal obligations like alimony or child support, may not be reflected on a <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> report.

For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any period of time that could result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option. In this example, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> for the balloon-payment mortgage is three years, and not the potential six years that could result if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> chooses to renew the loan. Accordingly, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using the maximum payment scheduled in the first five years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, which includes the balloon payment due at the end of the three-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. See comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii-A-Interp-4-ii" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(ii)(A)-4.ii</ref>, which provides an example of how to determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a three-year renewable balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref>.</content>

                    <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum possible time. Because the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s minimum monthly payments are less than the interest accrued each month, negative amortization occurs (i.e., the accrued but unpaid interest is added to the principal balance). Thus, assuming that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments for as long as possible and that the maximum interest rate of 10.5 percent is reached at the first rate adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), the negative amortization cap of 115 percent is reached on the due date of the 27th monthly payment and the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> as of that date. The <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> as of the due date of the 27th monthly payment is $229,251, and the remaining term of the loan is 27 years and nine months (333 months).</content>

                  <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to the 12.5 percent payment cap, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will begin making payments that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third year. Thus, the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 36th monthly payment. The <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> on that date is $207,662, and the remaining <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> is 27 years (324 months).

            <content>A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (e.g., month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</content>

The payment calculation methods differ depending on the type of <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> extended. The payment calculation method set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-c-5-i" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(5)(i)</ref> applies to any <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> that does not have a balloon payment, or that is not an interest-only or negative amortization loan, whether such <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is a fixed-rate, adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage. The terms “fixed-rate mortgage,” “adjustable-rate mortgage,” “step-rate mortgage,” “interest-only loan” and “negative amortization loan” are defined in § <ref target="1026-18-s-7-iii" reftype="internal">1026.18(s)(7)(iii)</ref>, <ref target="1026-18-i" reftype="internal">(i)</ref>, (ii), (iv) and (v), respectively.

The payment calculation methods set forth in § <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(5)(ii)</ref> apply to any <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> that is a loan with a balloon payment, interest-only loan, or negative amortization loan. See comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-i-Interp-5" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(i)-5</ref> and the commentary to § <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii-Interp" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(5)(ii)</ref>, which provide examples for calculating the monthly payment for purposes of the repayment ability determination required under § <ref target="1026-43-c-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)(iii)</ref>.</content>

        <content>Adjustable-rate mortgage with discount for three years. Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage has an initial discounted rate of 5 percent that is fixed for the first three years, measured from the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, after which the rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent. The loan agreement provides for an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2 percent, and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 12 percent. The first rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 36th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 7 percent (5 percent initial discounted rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The second rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 48th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 9 percent (7 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap). The third rate adjustment occurs on the due date of the 60th monthly payment; the rate can adjust to no more than 11 percent (9 percent rate plus 2 percent annual interest rate cap adjustment). The maximum interest rate during the first five years after the date on which the first regular periodic payment will be due is 11 percent (the rate on the due date of the 60th monthly payment).

          <content>General. For purposes of determining the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay a negative amortization loan, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use substantially equal, monthly payments of principal and interest based on the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> or the <ref target="1026-16-g-2-ii" reftype="term">introductory rate</ref>, whichever is greater, that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> over the term of the loan that remains as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Accordingly, before determining the substantially equal, monthly payments the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must first determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> and the period of time that remains in the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> after the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. “<ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">Recast</ref>” is defined in § <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="internal">1026.43(b)(11)</ref>. Second, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must use the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> or <ref target="1026-16-g-2-ii" reftype="term">introductory rate</ref>, whichever is greater, to calculate the substantially equal, monthly payment amount that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> over the term of the loan remaining as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>.

The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 8 percent (4.5 percent plus 3.5 percent). The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

            <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to the 12.5 percent payment cap, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will begin making payments that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third year.

          <content>Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the date on which the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 4.5 percent; the <ref target="1026-43-b-3" reftype="term">fully indexed rate</ref> is 8 percent (4.5 percent plus 3.5 percent). The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

          <content>To determine the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref>, assume that the interest rate increases to the maximum lifetime interest rate of 10.5 percent at the first adjustment (i.e., the due date of the first periodic monthly payment), and interest accrues at that rate until the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. Assume that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> makes the minimum monthly payments scheduled, which are capped at 7.5 percent from year-to-year, for the maximum possible time.

Under § <ref target="1026-43-d-1-ii-A" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)(1)(ii)(A)</ref>, a “standard mortgage” must provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization), allow the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to defer repayment of principal (see comment <ref target="1026-43-e-2-i-Interp-2" reftype="internal">43(e)(2)(i)-2</ref>), or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-5" reftype="term">loan amount</ref> over the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>.

For example, assume a <ref target="1026-43-b-1" reftype="term">covered transaction</ref> is consummated on March 20, 2014 and the due date of the first regular periodic payment is April 30, 2014.

        <content>Fixed-rate, graduated payment mortgage. A loan in the amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent, and requires the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> to make minimum monthly payments during the first year, with payments increasing 12.5 percent over the previous year every year for four years (the annual payment cap). The payment schedule provides for payments of $943 in the first year, $1,061 in the second year, $1,193 in the third year, $1,343 in the fourth year, and then requires $1,511 for the remaining term of the loan. During the first three years of the loan, the payments are less than the interest accrued each month, resulting in negative amortization. Assuming the minimum payments increase year-to-year up to the 12.5 percent payment cap, the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> will begin making payments that cover at least all of the interest accrued at the end of the third year. Thus, the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 36th monthly payment. The <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> on that date is $207,662, and the remaining <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> is 27 years (324 months). For purposes of § <ref target="1026-43-c-2-iii" reftype="internal">1026.43(c)(2)(iii)</ref>, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s ability to repay the loan based on a monthly payment of $1,497, which is the substantially equal, monthly payment of principal and interest that will repay the <ref target="1026-43-b-7" reftype="term">maximum loan amount</ref> of $207,662 over the remaining <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> of 27 years using the fixed interest rate of 7.5 percent.</content>

          <content>Definition of bona fide discount point. Section <ref target="1026-32-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(3)</ref> provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. To satisfy this standard, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market transactions. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on pricing in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary market. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also establish that its interest rate reduction is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide imposes a cap on points and fees but excludes from the cap discount points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a discount point and the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-E" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)</ref> or <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-F" reftype="internal">(F)</ref> are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the calculation of points and fees.</content>

For example, assume that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is providing a <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> with a refinancing made pursuant to § <ref target="1026-43-d" reftype="internal">1026.43(d)</ref> and that this <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> has a documented practice of offering rate discounts to <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumers</ref> with <ref target="1026-2-a-14" reftype="term">credit</ref> scores above a certain threshold.

          <content>Date of the <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>. The term “<ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref>” means, for an adjustable-rate mortgage, the expiration of the period during which payments based on the introductory fixed rate are permitted; for an interest-only loan, the expiration of the period during which the interest-only payments are permitted; and, for a negative amortization loan, the expiration of the period during which negatively amortizing payments are permitted. For adjustable-rate mortgages, interest-only loans, and negative amortization loans, the date on which the <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> is considered to occur is the due date of the last monthly payment based on the introductory fixed rate, the interest-only payment, or the negatively amortizing payment, respectively. To illustrate: A loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a fixed interest rate and permits interest-only payments for the first five years of the loan (60 months). The loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> on the due date of the 60th monthly payment. Thus, the term of the loan remaining as of the date the loan is <ref target="1026-43-b-11" reftype="term">recast</ref> is 25 years (300 months).</content>

        <content>Assume an adjustable-rate mortgage in the amount of $200,000 with a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides that the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> can make minimum monthly payments that cover only part of the interest accrued each month until the principal balance reaches 115 percent of its original balance (i.e., a negative amortization cap of 115 percent) or for the first five years of the loan (60 monthly payments), whichever occurs first. The introductory interest rate at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> is 1.5 percent. One month after the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, the interest rate adjusts and will adjust monthly thereafter based on the specified index plus a margin of 3.5 percent. The maximum lifetime interest rate is 10.5 percent; there are no other periodic interest rate adjustment caps that limit how quickly the maximum lifetime rate may be reached. The minimum monthly payment for the first year is based on the initial interest rate of 1.5 percent. After that, the minimum monthly payment adjusts annually, but may increase by no more than 7.5 percent over the previous year's payment. The minimum monthly payment is $690 in the first year, $742 in the second year, and $797 in the first part of the third year.</content>

          <content>Renewable balloon-payment mortgage; <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. A balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> could provide that a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> is unconditionally obligated to renew a balloon-payment mortgage at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s control). See comment <ref target="1026-17-c-1-Interp-11" reftype="internal">17(c)(1)-11</ref> discussing renewable balloon-payment mortgages. For purposes of this section, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> does not include any period of time that could result from a renewal provision. To illustrate, assume a three-year balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref> contains an unconditional obligation to renew for another three years at the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s option. In this example, the <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref> for the balloon-payment mortgage is three years, and not the potential six years that could result if the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref> chooses to renew the loan. Accordingly, the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> must underwrite the loan using the maximum payment scheduled in the first five years after <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, which includes the balloon payment due at the end of the three-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. See comment <ref target="1026-43-c-5-ii-A-Interp-4-ii" reftype="internal">43(c)(5)(ii)(A)-4.ii</ref>, which provides an example of how to determine the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>'s repayment ability for a three-year renewable balloon-payment mortgage that is not a <ref target="1026-43-b-4" reftype="term">higher-priced covered transaction</ref>.</content>

        <content>Definition of bona fide discount point. Section <ref target="1026-32-b-3" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(3)</ref> provides that, to be bona fide, a discount point must reduce the interest rate based on a calculation that is consistent with established industry practices for determining the amount of reduction in the interest rate or time-price differential appropriate for the amount of discount points paid by the <ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term">consumer</ref>. To satisfy this standard, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may show that the reduction is reasonably consistent with established industry norms and practices for secondary mortgage market transactions. For example, a <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may rely on pricing in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to establish that the interest rate reduction is consistent with the <ref target="1026-36-a-3" reftype="term">compensation</ref> that the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> could reasonably expect to receive in the secondary market. The <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> may also establish that its interest rate reduction is consistent with established industry practices by showing that its calculation complies with requirements prescribed in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines for interest rate reductions from bona fide discount points. For example, assume that the Fannie Mae Single-Family Selling Guide or the Freddie Mac Single Family Seller/Servicer Guide imposes a cap on points and fees but excludes from the cap discount points that result in a bona fide reduction in the interest rate. Assume the guidelines require that, for a discount point to be bona fide so that it would not count against the cap, a discount point must result in at least a 25 basis point reduction in the interest rate. Accordingly, if the <ref target="1026-2-a-17" reftype="term">creditor</ref> offers a 25 basis point interest rate reduction for a discount point and the requirements of § <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-E" reftype="internal">1026.32(b)(1)(i)(E)</ref> or <ref target="1026-32-b-1-i-F" reftype="internal">(F)</ref> are satisfied, the discount point is bona fide and is excluded from the calculation of points and fees.</content>

Notes:
i. This policy assures that a &lt;ref target="1026-2-a-11" reftype="term"&gt;consumer&lt;/ref&gt; either has sufficient income to make both mortgage payments without any rentalincome, or has an equity position not likely to result in defaulting on the mortgage on the property being vacated.
ii. This applies solely to a principal residence being vacated in favor of another principal residence. It does not apply to existing rental properties disclosed on the loan application and confirmed by tax returns (Schedule E of form IRS 1040).

To illustrate, assume a loan in an amount of $200,000 has a 30-year <ref target="1026-43-b-6" reftype="term">loan term</ref>. The loan agreement provides for a discounted interest rate of 5 percent that is fixed for an initial period of three years, measured from the first day of the first full calendar month following <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref>, after which the interest rate will adjust annually based on a specified index plus a margin of 3 percent, subject to a 2 percent annual interest rate adjustment cap and a lifetime maximum interest rate of 9 percent. The index value in effect at <ref target="1026-2-a-13" reftype="term">consummation</ref> equals 4.5 percent.
