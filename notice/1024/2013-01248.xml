A Public Guidance Document entitled “Consumer Disclosure for Voluntary <ref target="1024-17-b-EscrowAccount" reftype="term">Escrow Account</ref> Payments” provides a model disclosure format that originators and <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicers</ref> are encouraged, but not required, to provide to consumers when the originator or <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> anticipates a substantial increase in disbursements from the <ref target="1024-17-b-EscrowAccount" reftype="term">escrow account</ref> after the first year of the loan.

In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including, but not limited to,” “among other things,” “for example,” or “such as.”

            <content>Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that the comment interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § <ref target="1024-37-c-1" reftype="internal">1024.37(c)(1)</ref> are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment <ref target="1024-37-c-1-i-Interp-1" reftype="internal">37(c)(1)(i)-1</ref>. In other cases, comments have more general <ref target="1024-2-b-Application" reftype="term">application</ref> and are designated, for example, as comment <ref target="1024-40-a-Interp-1" reftype="internal">40(a)-1</ref>.

A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> shall treat the notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> as having been submitted by the borrower.</content>

              <content>A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> should not rely solely on the borrower's description of a submission to determine whether the submission constitutes a notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> under § <ref target="1024-35-a" reftype="internal">1024.35(a)</ref>, an information request under § <ref target="1024-36-a" reftype="internal">1024.36(a)</ref>, or both. For example, a borrower may submit a letter that claims to be a “Notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">Error</ref>” that indicates that the borrower wants to receive the information set forth in an annual <ref target="1024-2-b-Settlement" reftype="term">escrow</ref> account statement and asserts an <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> for the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>'s failure to provide the borrower an annual <ref target="1024-2-b-Settlement" reftype="term">escrow</ref> statement. Such a letter may constitute an information request under § <ref target="1024-36-a" reftype="internal">1024.36(a)</ref> that triggers an obligation by the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> to provide an annual <ref target="1024-2-b-Settlement" reftype="term">escrow</ref> statement. A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> should not rely on the borrower's characterization of the letter as a “Notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">Error</ref>,” but must evaluate whether the letter fulfills the substantive requirements of a notice of <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref>, information request, or both.</content>

For example, if a borrower makes a monthly payment in February for a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>, but asserts an <ref target="1024-35-b" reftype="term">error</ref> relating to the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>'s acceptance of the February payment, § <ref target="1024-35-h" reftype="internal">1024.35(h)</ref> does not alter a borrower's obligation to make a monthly payment that the borrower owes for March.

              <content><ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. A <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to an information request for the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by identifying the person on whose behalf the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> receives payments from the borrower. Although investors or guarantors, including among others the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association, may be exposed to risks related to the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> held by a trust either in connection with an investment in securities issued by the trust or the issuance of a guaranty agreement to the trust, such investors or guarantors are not the owners or assignees of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loans</ref> solely as a result of their roles as such. In certain circumstances, however, a party such as a guarantor may assume multiple roles for a securitization transaction. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association may act as trustee, master <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref>, and guarantor in connection with a securitization transaction in which a trust owns a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> subject to a request. In this example, because the Federal National Mortgage Association is the trustee of the trust that owns the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>, a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by providing the name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association as the trustee. The following examples identify the owner or assignee for different forms of <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> ownership:</content>

In general, in a securitization transaction, a special purpose vehicle, such as a trust, is the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref>. Thus, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> receives the borrower's payments on behalf of the trust. If a securitization transaction is structured such that a trust is the owner or assignee of a <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> and the trust is administered by an appointed trustee, a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> complies with § <ref target="1024-36-d" reftype="internal">1024.36(d)</ref> by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner or assignee of the <ref target="1024-2-b-FederallyRelatedMortgageLoanOrMortgageLoan" reftype="term">mortgage loan</ref> by providing the borrower with the name of the trust and the name, address, and appropriate contract information for the trustee.

                <content>For guidance on the circumstances under which a borrower is delinquent for purposes of § <ref target="1024-39" reftype="internal">1024.39</ref>, see comment <ref target="1024-39-a-Interp-1" reftype="internal">39(a)-1</ref>. For example, if a payment due date is January 1 and the payment remains unpaid during the 45-day period after January 1, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> must provide the written notice within 45 days after January 1— i.e., by February 15. However, if a borrower satisfies a late payment in full before the end of the 45-day period, the <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> need not provide the written notice. For example, if a borrower misses a January 1 due date but makes that payment on February 1, a <ref target="1024-2-b-Servicer" reftype="term">servicer</ref> need not provide the written notice by February 15.</content>
