Charges for loan origination and <ref target="1024-2-b-TitleService" reftype="term">title services</ref> should not be itemized except as provided in these instructions. For each separately identified <ref target="1024-2-b-SettlementService" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> in connection with the transaction, the name of the person ultimately receiving the payment must be shown together with the total amount paid to such person.

That charge should also be offset by listing a credit in that amount to the borrower on lines 204-209 on page 1 of the <ref target="1024-2-b-HUD" reftype="term">HUD</ref>-1, and by a charge to the seller in lines 506-509 on page 1 of the <ref target="1024-2-b-HUD" reftype="term">HUD</ref>-1.

Here, A's clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a “title agent” is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services for which he assumes liability, and which includes at a minimum, the evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the <ref target="1024-2-b-TitleCompany" reftype="term">title company</ref>. A may not be compensated for the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the referral of <ref target="1024-2-b-SettlementService" reftype="term">settlement service</ref> business, it has violated section 8 of <ref target="1024-2-b-RESPA" reftype="term">RESPA</ref>.</content>

The payment of a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners, such arrangements would violate section 8. The exemption for controlled business arrangements would not be available because the payments here would not be considered returns on ownership interests.
